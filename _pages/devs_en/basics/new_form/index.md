This group of articles describes how to define various forms in admin area utilizing the _new_ API based on [Symfony/Form](http://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) view components.

Also, new API uses the DTO (Data-Transfer Object) approach, which is used to transport and validate data on its way to the entity and back. This allows to maintain several principles of a good architecture, such as [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).

You can start reading from {% link 'Model editing' ref_8MoO0Ob %} page and proceed later to this guides:

*   {% link 'Form model DTO and validation' ref_S60wDZGW %}

{% note info %}
The majority of entity editing pages in admin area use native X-Cart's approach for {% link "creating entity editing forms" ref_LanG54L9 %}. It applies to category, order, user and other pages.
