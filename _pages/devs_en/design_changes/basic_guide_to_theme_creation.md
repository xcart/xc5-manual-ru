## Introduction

This article aims to teach designers how they can create X-Cart skin using preemptive (or substitutional) template model. This guide will also introduce **Custom Skin** module and will give real life example of how to work with preemptive templates in X-Cart.

Before you get started, we recommend learning the {% link "basic designer guide" ref_E88KCMDD %} from **Getting started** section.

Also, you might want to read about advanced {% link 'skin module definition' ref_skinmodule %}.

## Registering themes in the module

If we want to make our module to be a skin and dramatically change the X-Cart appearance, there is a special way how to do it:

1. {% link "Create an empty module" ref_G2mlgckf %}. In this article, I will be using module with developer ID as **Tony** and module ID as **SkinDemo**.
2. Add the following method into your `Main.php` file 

    ```php
        public static function getSkins()
        {
            return array(
                \XLite::CUSTOMER_INTERFACE => array(
                    'TonyTheme/customer',
                ),
                \XLite::ADMIN_INTERFACE => array(
                    'TonyTheme/admin',
                ),
            );
        }
    ```

    This method tells X-Cart that this module registers new templates for customer area (they are located in the `<X-Cart>/skins/TonyTheme/customer/en/` folder) and new templates for admin area (they are located in the `<X-Cart>/skins/TonyTheme/admin/en/` folder)

3.  Create aforementioned directories: `<X-Cart>/skins/TonyTheme/customer/en/` and `<X-Cart>/skins/TonyTheme/admin/en/`
4.  After we have done all this and re-deployed the store, X-Cart will start looking for templates in our newly created folders first (`<X-Cart>/skins/TonyTheme/customer/en/` and `<X-Cart>/skins/TonyTheme/admin/en/`) and if it does not find them there, it will start looking for them in default skin folders (`<X-Cart>/skins/default/en/`, `<X-Cart>/skins/admin/en/`)
5.  In order to make sure that everything works as we expect, let us try to override `<X-Cart>/skins/default/en/welcome.tpl` template which is responsible for display of welcome message in store-front.
6.  We just create the template `<X-Cart>/skins/TonyTheme/customer/en/welcome.tpl` with the following text: 

    ```php
    Hello world! This is a piece of text to display as welcome message.
    ```

7.  Check the store-front with re-deploying the store. It should display our welcome message there, while rest of the layout will be the same.![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8224814/8355867.png)
8.  _Important note: if you override templates that contain @ListChild directives, do not keep this directive in the overriding template. Otherwise X-Cart will include this template twice._

## Module example

You can download this module sample here: [Tony-SkinDemo-v5_1_0.tar]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/modules/Tony-SkinDemo-v5_1_0.tar)

## Using ThemeTweaker module

This part is more focused on merchants, because it introduces the **ThemeTweaker** module that eases the process of adjusting your store design without having to create your own module.

Let us assume a task that you want to get rid of exclamation marks from notifications about orders changed their status. Here is how you can approach it:

1.  Go to your admin area and enable the **ThemeTweaker** module in your **Extensions** > **Installed** **modules** section. This module is free for all X-Cart pakages.
2.  Once the module is enabled, we should find what template defines the **Order receipt #1234!** messages. We can do it using the approach described earlier or just by searching files for **Order receipt** substring. These templates are:
    - `skins/mail/en/order_advanced_changed/subject.tpl`
    - `skins/mail/en/order_changed/subject.tpl`
    - `skins/mail/en/order_processed/subject.tpl`
    - `skins/mail/en/order_shipped/subject.tpl`
3.  Now we need to override these templates as explained earlier in this article – by putting substituting templates into the custom skin folders. ThemeTweaker module already has directories where you can put such templates and these templates will override default layout. These directories are:
    - `skins/theme_tweaker/customer/` for customer interface
    - `skins/theme_tweaker/mail/` for email notifications interface
4.  We create the `<X-Cart>/skins/theme_tweaker/mail/en/order_advanced_changed/subject.tpl` with the following content: 

    ```php
    {config.Company.company_name:h}: {t(#Order receipt#)} #{order.getOrderNumber()}
    ```

    in other words, we just remove the exclamation mark from the notification. The same way create three other overriding templates.

5. If {% link "developer mode is enabled" ref_G2mlgckf#packing-up-your-module %} in your store, effect will take place immediately after you save the templates, without having to re-deploy the store.
6.  Surely, you can apply more complex modifications to your store layout using the same approach.
