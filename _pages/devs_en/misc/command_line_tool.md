X-Cart command line (CLI) tool is the collection of helpful commands for your use while developing your modules. This tool is included with X-Cart starting from 5.3.3.4 version and it is driven by the powerful Symfony Console component.

## Usage

To run the CLI tool, you should switch to the X-Cart working directory and run:

```
php xc5 <command> <arguments>
```

{% note %}
To run X-Cart commands from any directory, add `<your X-Cart install dir>` to your system PATH.

Because shells have differing syntax, consult a reference like [unix.stackexchange.com](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables).

bash shell example for CentOS:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/var/www/html/xcart
```

{% endnote %}
