Once the X-Cart software installation process has been [completed](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/installation/installation_guide.html#step-7-installation-completed "Admin Area Login and Password Recovery"), you can get to managing products, orders, customers, and most other features of your store. But first you need to log in to your X-Cart store Admin area. If you forget the admin password, you can recover it at any time using the email address that is associated with the account.

## Admin Area Login

1. In the address bar of your browser, enter the URL that was specified during the X-Cart software installation, followed by the base URL of your storeâ€™s Admin area. 
   
   The default Admin URL looks like this: `http://<your-domain>/<x-cart-5-directory>/admin.php?target=login`
   
   You should see a page like this:
   ![login-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_00nAL9h3/login-page.png)
   
   {% note info %}
   You can bookmark the Admin Login page for easy access.
   {% endnote %}
   
2. Enter your email and password for the Admin area.

   The initial Admin area login credentials were set up during [Step 2 of the X-Cart software installation](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/installation/installation_guide.html#step-2-creating-administrator-account "Admin Area Login and Password Recovery").

## Admin Area Password Recovery
