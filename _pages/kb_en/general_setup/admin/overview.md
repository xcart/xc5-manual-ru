When you log in to your X-Cart store Admin area, the first thing that you see is the Admin area Home page:
![541-admin-home-signed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/541-admin-home-signed.png)

X-Cart Admin Home page shows information about orders awaiting processing, bestseller products and products with low stock, as well as your storeâ€™s recent sales stats and other usefull information. Right after the software installation, the Admin Home page also provides the {% link "X-Cart Quickstart Onboarding Wizard" ref_5xTo5Gmg %} that aims to help a store admin with the initial store setup.

{% note info %}
Attention the users of X-Cart Cloud, the Quickstart Onboarding Wizard has a different interface in this software version. For more info, see {% link "X-Cart Cloud Onboarding Wizard" ref_0UvAdIRA %}.
{% endnote %}

To return to the Home page from any other page of the Admin area, click on the store logo icon in the left-hand side of the header panel.

## Admin Header

The Admin area header shows the version of the X-Cart software being used and includes some tools for quick navigation and search through the store, as well as a tool to open or close the storefront for customers. These are accessible from any page of the store Admin area. In addition to that, the header shows software update alerts and App Store notifications. It also gives access to the admin user profile and the X-Cart Knowledge Base (also known as the X-Cart manual, or X-Cart user docs) which can be of help for store setup and management.

### Software Version

The information on the software edition and current version displays at the far left of the Admin area header.
![541-version.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/541-version.png)

This block is visible only if the [Sidebar Menu](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/admin/overview.html#sidebar-menu "Admin Area Overview") is expanded. In regular mode this information is hidden and the header looks as follows:
![541-header-regular.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/541-header-regular.png)


### Quick Menu

The navigation menu in the header allows a store admin to add a new product, category, user or discount coupon in about one click from any page of the Admin area. All they need to do is expand the quick navigation menu and click on the respective icon.
![541-quick-menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/541-quick-menu.png)

## Search Bar

The search bar in the header allows you to quick-search through the products, users and orders from any page of the Admin area. 
![541-quick-search.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/541-quick-search.png)

To use the tool, select the type of data through which you would like to search in the dropdown and type your search request in the search bar.

If you prefer typing by hand to selecting from the dropdown menu, simply type in your request in the search bar using the format `<data type key>: <your search request>` (for example, "o: 00004" if you are searching for Order #00004) and hit Enter.

### Storefront Accessibility

A store admin can access the storefront and open/close it for customers in one click directly from the header of the Admin area. 

The toggle switch to open or close the storefront for customers can be found in the right-hand side of the Admin header. Next to the switch, an admin link for access to the storefront is provided. While the storefront is open for customers, the link says "View storefront" and is green in color. While the storefront is closed, it says "Storefront is closed" and appears red. 

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>Storefront is open</i>![storefront-on.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/storefront-on.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>Storefront is closed</i>![stofront-off.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/stofront-off.png)</div>
</div>
 
Note that an admin can use the link to access the storefront regardless of whether its current state is open or closed. The storefront will be opened in a new browser tab, and for the admin it will appear as open/working in any case, even after it has been set to the closed state with the toggle switch in the Admin area header. That is due to the fact that for an admin accessing the storefront via the admin link a special storefront activation ShopKey is used. The ShopKey enables the store's admin users to check the storefront operation while the store is closed for customers. To be able see the storefront in exactly the way it looks to customers, a store admin will need to log out of their account or open the storefront in an incognito window of the web browser.  

### Admin Account and Help Docs

To edit your personal admin account information, open the dropdown menu under the Admin icon in the right-hand side of the header and select 'My profile'.
![my-profile.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/my-profile.png)

From the same dropdown menu, a store admin can access the X-Cart Knowledge Base and Dev Docs, suggest an idea on the software improvement, report a software bug or contact X-Cart using the 'Contact Us' form at [www.x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html "Admin Area Overview").

## Sidebar Menu

![541-sidebar-menu-hidden.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2DXFvdbo/541-sidebar-menu-hidden.png)
