When you enter the Admin Home page of your X-Cart Cloud store for the first time, you will see the "Ready for Sales" quickstart in the middle of the page. This section aims to help a store admin to configure shipping and payments in the store to be ready to sell online. Also, it provides quick access to the X-Cart App Store, where it is possible to enhance the basic package with extra addons.
