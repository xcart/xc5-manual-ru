By default, all notifications in your store - except for the ones sent to customers - are sent to the administrator email address specified during X-Cart installation. If your store staff consists of more than just one person, or you want to use different email addresses for different types of notifications, you can add more recipient addresses for email notifications. This can be done via the Contacts section of your store profile (**Store setup > Store profile (ex. Contact information**)):

![contacts.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_wKcxbiUf/contacts.png)

You can set four kinds of contact email addresses:

   *   **Site administrator e-mail**:
   
       The email address(es) specified in this field will be used as the 'to' address for the following email messages:
    
       * notification about the generation of the store's safe mode access key (the message with your Hard and Soft reset links);
       * notifications about failed administrator login attempts 
       * notification about a product's stock level reaching the low limit ("Low limit warning");
       * notification about the completion of a data export process (may be sent when data export takes a long time).

       The email address(es) specified in this field will also be used as the 'from' address for the following email messages:
    
       * notifications about the creation, modification or deletion of user profiles (sent to the Customer relations department and the user);
       * notifications about failed administrator login attempts (sent to the site administrator);
       * notifications about the creation, modification and processing of orders (sent to the Sales department and the customer);
       * notifications about the shipping of orders (sent to the customer);
       * notifications about failed and canceled orders (sent to the Sales department);
       * notification about the generation of the store's safe mode access key (the message with your Hard and Soft reset links).
       

   *   **Customer relations e-mail**: 
   
       The email address(es) specified in this field will be used as the 'to' address for the following email messages:

Please contact the `<a href=\"mailto:{{email}}\">store administrator</a>`.", which is displayed to customers when there are no payment methods available to them at checkout.
