If necessary you can add a PDF version of an invoice to email notifications by enabling the setting **Send the PDF version of invoices in the attachments** on the **Attachments** tab of the **Store setup** -> **Email notifications** page.

A PDF invoice will be added as an attachment to all order related notifications.

{% note info %}
You can extend the default PDF invoices feature with a paid {% link "PDF Invoices" ref_4pIx0x0g %} addon that is more flexible and powerful.
