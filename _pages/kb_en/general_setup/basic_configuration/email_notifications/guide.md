A store administrator can enable, disable and edit the notifications' content if required. 


Admin notifications have an ON/OFF switch in the 'Administrator' column, customer notifications - an ON/OFF switch in the 'Customer' column, respectively. 

Each email notification is identified by a title and has a mention that describes the purpose of the notification.
