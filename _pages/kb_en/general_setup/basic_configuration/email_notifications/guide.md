ADDON NOTIFICATIONS
  
  The notifications added by addons installed in the store have the addon name in the notification title and can vary. Such notifications are added and removed automatically when the addon to which they pertain is installed or deleted/disabled.

## Managing Email Notifications

For the notifications to send, it is not enough to activate them in the notifications list. A store admin must also configure the store email addresses properly and test the email transfer settings to ensure email notifications delivered to the end-user.

### Enabling Email Notifications

A store administrator can enable and disable email notifications directly on the listing page (**Store setup** -> **Email notifications**) in the store Admin area.

To enable/disable a notification for a user type (Administrator or Customer) it is necessary to set the ON/OFF toggle for this user type to the corresponding value opposite a notification.

In case the ON/OFF toggle is in faded-green a notification can not be disabled.

### Editing Email Notifications

If necessary a store admin can edit each notificaton content (a message sent to the end-user via email to notify about an event) as well as the header, greeting and signature for all store notifications at once. 

More information on managing notifications content is available in the following articles:

*  {% link "Editing Email Notifications" ref_1qTqS245 %}
*  {% link "Adding PDF Invoices to Email Notifications" ref_08i5p47o %}
*  {% link "Using Variables to Configure Email  Notifications" ref_6fJMVyRl %}

### Configuring Store Email Addresses

Along with enabling email notifications in a store a store admin must check that the store contact email addresses are configured properly. If necessary a store admin can add more than one contact email to separate incoming notifications between staff.

More information on configuring store email addresses see in:
*  {% link "Specifying Your Contact Email Addresses" ref_wKcxbiUf %}

### Configuring and Testing Email Transfer Settings

When the notifications content and email adderesses are configured for the store, it is necessary to check that all notifications are delivered to the end-user without issues.

For this purpose it will be necessary to set up email transfer settings in the **Store setup** -> **Email notifications** sections of your store Admin area and check the deliverability there.
