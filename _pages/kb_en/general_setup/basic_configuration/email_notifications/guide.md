* Addon notifications.


Here a store administrator can enable, disable and edit the notifications' content. 

Some of the notifications are sent to both the store staff and customers, others - only to the store staff or only to customers. 



Admin notifications have an ON/OFF switch in the 'Administrator' column, customer notifications - an ON/OFF switch in the 'Customer' column, respectively. 

Each email notification is identified by a title and has a mention that describes the purpose of the notification.

For email notifications that are added by an addon, the name of the addon is mentioned in the notification title. Such notifications are added and removed automatically when the addon to which they pertain is installed or deleted/disabled.
