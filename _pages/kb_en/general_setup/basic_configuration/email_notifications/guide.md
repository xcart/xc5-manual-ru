  The notifications added by addons installed in the store have the addon name in the notification title and can vary. Such notifications are added and removed automatically when the addon to which they pertain is installed or deleted/disabled.

## Managing Email Notifications

A store administrator can enable and disable email notifications directly on the listing page (**Store setup** -> **Email notifications**) in the store Admin area.

To enable/disable a notification for a user type (Administrator or Customer) it is necessary to set the ON/OFF toggle for this user type to the corresponding value opposite a notification. In case the ON/OFF toggle is in faded-green a notification can not be disabled.
