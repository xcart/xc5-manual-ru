Your store can detect various types of events and notify users about these events by email. For example, your store sends email notifications when someone creates a user profile at your store, when this profile is modified, when a new order is created, and then every time the order status changes, and so on. Some notifications are sent to the store staff (like the site administrator, sales department, customer service, etc.), others - to the customers (namely, the users who created order, the users whose profile has been modified and so on). 

All email notifications are sent automatically. A store administrator can allow sending only the required notifications and block others using special tools in the store Admin area. It is also possible to adjust the default notification content to meet particular business needs .
