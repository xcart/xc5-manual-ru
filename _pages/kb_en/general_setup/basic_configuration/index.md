Once X-Cart software is installed start with the basic store configuration. Name your store and add some essential business information like company logo, name and address. Set the default store timezone, currency and weight unit. Configure your store contact emails and email notifications that will be sent to the store staff and customers. Set up zones, taxes and shipping and configure payments to make checkout working. This is a shortlist of what needs to be set up to launch the store.
