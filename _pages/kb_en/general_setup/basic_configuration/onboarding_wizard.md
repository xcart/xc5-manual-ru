When you enter your X-Cart store Admin Home page for the first time after the installation of X-Cart software, you cannot miss the green box that says "Let's set up your store! - **Proceed**". That is the place to start X-Cart's Quickstart Onboarding Wizard. The Onboarding Wizard is an addon that is aimed to help the store administrator with the initial store configuration and setup.

To start the store configuration process using the Onboarding Wizard, click **Proceed**.

## Onboarding Wizard Welcome

First of all, the Onboarding Wizard will welcome you and provide an outline of the steps that you will need to take to complete your store configuration.

![quickstart-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-1.png)

To continue with your store configuration, click **Let's set up your store!**. This will take you to the first step of the wizard.

If you don't wish to use the wizard now, you can close it using one of the buttons: 

* **Skip and remind me later** - This button will close the wizard so it will not be in your way while you are exploring your store's Admin area; however, you will be able to access the wizard at any time later via the green "Let's set up your store!" box.
* **Close and don't show again** - This button will close the wizard for good; the green box will no longer be displayed on the Admin Home page.
 
## Step 1 - Add Your First Product

The wizard will suggest that you should start the store configuration with adding your first product. 

![quickstart-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-2.png)

If you are not ready to add a product right now, you can skip this step and add products later. 

Your newly installed X-Cart store has a pack of demo products that you can use to test the basic store functionality.

You can add your own products later on, and not necessarily by doing it manually one-by-one. The built-in {% link "Import-Export" ref_TANvG2De %} tool can help you to add your entire product catalog at once.

If you decide to move on with adding your first product, you will need to name this product, set the product price and upload an image of the product either from your local computer or via URL. (Just tap on the image area to see your options). 

This is what this step may look like after all the required product fields have been completed:

![quickstart-2-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-2-2.png)

If you wish to set more product details (like product weight, description, sale price, etc.), use the "Add other options" link. As a result, the full version of the {% link "product details page" ref_2D8wAeXP %} for the product you are configuring will be opened in a new browser tab. There you will be able to finish configuring the product details and save your changes. Again, you do not have to complete all the product fields right now - you can go back to editing any of the products in your store catalog at any time later. Detailed information on how to create and manage products in your X-Cart store without using the Onboarding Wizard and how to configure all the product fields is available in the section {% link "Products and Catalog" ref_uymkBt6a %} of this manual. 

Let's suppose you have configured all the required product fields at the first step of the Onboarding Wizard to create your first product. Now you can click the button **Save and go to the next step**.

The wizard will suggest that you take a look at your new product on the storefront. 

![quickstart-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-3.png)

Note that this page also gives you an opportunity to delete all the demo products that are present in your store. You can do that if you are ready to populate the store catalog with your own products. If not, keep the demo products a bit longer. You may need them to test the basic store functioning.

Click **Proceed to the next step** to go further.

## Step 2 - Upload Your Company Logo

On Step 2 you can upload your company logo that will be displayed on the top on all pages of the store. The store logo serves not only as branding for your site, but links back to your homepage.
![quickstart-4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-4.png)

The store logo can also be uploaded from your local computer or via URL. Tap on the logo area to see the options. 

The recommended logo size is 400x150 px, the recommended file formats are PNG. JPG and GIF.

Your store logo will be a part of your company style and will visualize your brand to the site visitors. So take this step seriously. If you don't have a good selling logo, just [ask](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html#design "X-Cart Quickstart Onboarding Wizard") and we'll help you with it. 


## Step 3 - Set Up Your Store Locale and Company Info

On Step 3 you can configure geographic settings to connect your store with local customers and set your company info that will be used to form invoices, send email notifications and calculate shipping rates for your store.

Start with the store locale. It has the predefined country, currency and weight values based on the info the wizard get during the software installation. However, these values may not always be correct. So you need to verify and change the data if required.

![quickstart-5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-5.png)

If everything is correct click **Proceed to the next step** to move on with the company details info. 

If you need to go deep into the store localization click **More localization settings** and the wizard will open the Store setup -> Localization page in a new tab where {% link "more options" ref_cc4sCpa5 %} area available.

On the Company info page you'll need to fill in the company name and business address. This address will be used as a "from" address for the store shipping setup.

![quickstart-6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-6.png)

Click **Save and go to the next step** when you are ready.

## Step 4 - Set Up Delivery Options

Step 4 of your store configuration is devoted to shipping. 

First of all here you'll need to choose whether you'll sell tangible goods that need shipping or whether these will be e-goods and services that are non-shippable. 

![quickstart-7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-7.png)

If you are selling e-goods and services everything is pretty simple. Click **Mark all products as non-shippable** and that's it! The wizard will set the [Requires shipping product option](https://kb.x-cart.com/products/products/managing_products/adding_products/basic_product_setup.html#shipping "X-Cart Quickstart Onboarding Wizard") for all products in your store to NO and all shipping methods will be disabled automatically.

If you sell tangible goods, the process is a bit more complicated. You need to set up shipping options for them. For this purpose click the **Set up shipping** button.

You'll see a page where you can configure shipping rates for your store:

![quickstart-7-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-7-1.png)

On this page you can choose between shipping carriers with real-time shipping quotes and your own flat shipping rate that you can create directly on this page. Just choose the destination country and set the rate, then click the **Create shipping rate** button. This shipping method will become available at checkout. 

For a more detailed shipping setup click the **Advanced shipping options** button and the wizard will open the Store setup -> Shipping page of the Admin area in the new tab where you can {% link "move on further" ref_3TG6AuN0 %}. 

If you choose real-time shipping carriers, click on the carrier logo and you'll be redirected to the carrier service page to set up an account with them. 

When the shipping setup is over you can proceed to the last step of this wizard - payments setup.

## Step 5 - Set Up Payment Methods

Payment methods setup is the last but not the least step of the Quickstart Onboarding Wizard. 
![quickstart-8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5xTo5Gmg/quickstart-8.png)

X-Cart allows to choose whether you'll use one or more of over 120 integrated online payment systems or whether you will process payments offline by your own means. 

By default, off-line demo payment methods are pre-configured and enabled. They are quite enough to test your new X-Cart store functioning. So if that's the purpose, leave the present configuration settings as is and **Proceed to the next step** (complete the store setup with the wizard).

However, if you want to process real orders, you need to configure real payment methods that will work for your customers. Click the **Set up offline & online payments** button for the wizard to open the Store setup -> Payments page in a new tab. Configure payment methods for your store {% link "following the guides of this manual" ref_Jq6Bsdrt %}. 

Once the payments setup is complete, you are finished and can close the wizard.
