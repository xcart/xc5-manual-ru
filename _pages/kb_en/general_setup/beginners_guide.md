## Before You Start

Before you start setting up your X-Cart store, it is important to find a reliable hosting provider for your store that will meet the [X-Cart sofware system requirements](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/installation_guide.html#server-requirements "Beginners Guide"). Be sure to set up a memorable and easy to type store domain so your customers can find your store online.

## First Steps

Once your X-Cart store has been installed, it is time to configure it. Before you stock your X-Cart store with products, you need to enter some business information about yourself and your store. You need to decide on some basic standards for your product listings and storefront options representation.

- {% link "Configure the store general settings" ref_qAZlJxZm %}

## Basic Store Setup

An important part of your online store setup process will be deciding what your store should look like and what kinds of products you are going to sell. 

X-Cart comes with a few design themes, and you can try them all to see which one looks best. If none of the default themes suits you, check for extra design templates in the [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/).

Add some products to sell. Depending on how many products you plan to offer, adding and organizing your product listings can be the most time-consuming step of setting up your X-Cart store. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to add your products, to organize them, and to configure the necessary payment methods, tax rates and shipping options.

There are several online channels that you can add to X-Cart when selling online. These channels are optional, but each one can be used to maximize your store's audience.
