## Activate a Free X-Cart 5 License

This section explains how to activate a Free X-Cart 5 license to turn your X-Cart trial installation into a real X-Cart 5 Free edition store.

To start the activation process for a Free X-Cart 5 license, choose to **Activate free license** in the Admin area of your X-Cart 5 trial installation. For your convenience, this activate license link can be accessed using any of the methods below:  

   *   _Method 1:_
       In the popup box with the X-Cart Business trial expiration notice (this box appears every time you sign in to the Admin area), click on the "I have a license key" link:

       This will expand the popup box further down, an a link to activate a free X-Cart license will be revealed:

       Click on the link to activate a free license.
       
   *   _Method 2:_ In the Admin area site header, click **Activate license key**:
       ![activate_in_topmessage.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_topmessage.png)

       A popup box titled **License key registration** will be displayed with a link to activate a free X-Cart license. 
       
       Click on the link to activate a free license.

   *    _Method 3:_ In the Admin menu, select **My addons** to go to the My Addons section. In this section, click the **Activate license key** button:
        ![activate_in_myaddons.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_myaddons.png)

        A popup box titled **Activate your X-Cart installation first** will be displayed with a link to activate a free X-Cart license. 

        Click on the link to activate a free license:
        ![activate_in_myaddons1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_myaddons1.png)


Once you have selected to activate a free X-Cart license, the popup box will be closed, and you will see a page with a warning about the consequences of free license activation:
         ![free_license_activation_warning.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/free_license_activation_warning.png)

Since the X-Cart 5 Business package on which the trial version is based includes more addons than the X-Cart 5 Free edition, activation of the Free license will cause some of the addons on your X-Cart installation to be removed. So basically what you see on this page is a list of addons that will be removed from your X-Cart installation.

Review the "to be removed" list and confirm your intention to continue with the activation of the Free license. If at a later time you need any of the addons that were removed as a result of the activation of the Free license, you will be able to upgrade your license to Premium and install the addons from the Premium package.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter the email address to which you want X-Cart to register your Free license. Then click **Activate**.
          ![free_license_activation.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/free_license_activation.png)

X-Cart will activate your license, and the store will be re-deployed. The process may take as long as a few minutes. Take care not to close the page before the process has been fully completed.

Once your store has been re-deployed, you should see a success message.
          ![all_done.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/all_done.png)

Now you should check that you can open your X-Cart store Admin area and storefront, and navigate a few pages to make sure everything looks good (no error messages or obvious page display problems). 

You will notice that the Admin area header now shows the license type you have activated:
