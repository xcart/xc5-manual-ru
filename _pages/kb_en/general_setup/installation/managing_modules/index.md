The functionality of your X-Cart 5 based store can be extended by installing addons (modules).Â 

After installing X-Cart 5 you will find that your store has some addons installed already. You can view their list in the Installed Addons section (available via the **My addons** menu item in the Admin menu). You can enable/disable and even delete addons according to your needs.

It is possible to obtain and install more addons. A great selection of addons for X-Cart 5 is available via the X-Cart App Store; however, addons can also be obtained from other sources. 

{% note info %}
Starting from X-Cart 5.4.x all manipulations with the software addons are perfromed in a special environment (**Upgrade System** screen) separate from the rest of the store. This was done to ensure that any changes applied to a store via new addons' installation or present addons' upgrade or deletion can be safely rolled back in case of any malfunction.

The Upgrade System environment is opened from the **My Addons** menu section in the store Admin area.
