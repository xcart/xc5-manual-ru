One of the improvements of the Admin area tools introduced in X-Cart 5.4.x is a separate environment for the management of the software core's and addons' updates and upgrades. Such an environment was created to ensure the overall store security and stability especially during the new core and/or addon updates installation. Provided the software upgrades and addons' installations, deletions and updates are separated from the rest of the store functionality, a store admin can check the Admin area and storefront functioning in a new window right after the changes have been applied and can roll back the updates easily and safely in case of any malfunction.
