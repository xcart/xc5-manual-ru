One of the improvements of the Admin area tools introduced in X-Cart 5.4.x is a separate environment for the management of the software core's and addons' updates and upgrades. Such an environment was created to ensure the overall store security and stability especially during the 
core and/or addon updates installation. Provided the software upgrades and addons' installations, deletions, and updates are separated from the rest of the store functionality, a store admin can check the Admin area and storefront functioning in a new window right after the changes have been applied, and can roll back the updates safely and easily in case of any malfunction.

## Upgrade System UI

To access the **Upgrade System** environment a store admin should click on the **My addons** link in the main menu of the Admin area. This opens a screen different from the Admin area where it is possible to install new and manage existing addons, as well as apply minor amd major software upgrades. By default, the new screen is displayed in the same tab your store Admin area was opened in.

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>X-Cart Admin area</b>![my-addons-admin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5Br376jE/my-addons-admin.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>X-Cart Upgrade System</b>![my-addons-service.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5Br376jE/my-addons-service.png)</div>
</div>

To return to the Admin area or open the storefront use the corresponding links at the top of the page. The Admin area will be opened in the same tab, while the storefront - in a new one.

The main menu of the Upgrade System screen consists of a search bar and 5 section:
* **All Addons** : This section is a room for [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ "Upgrade System Screen") where you can find and buy new addons for your store. 
  ![all-addons.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5Br376jE/all-addons.png)
* **Templates** : This section displays all templates available in the [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/ "Upgrade System Screen").
  ![templates.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5Br376jE/templates.png)
* **My Addons** (opened by default by a click from the Admin area) : This section displays all addons installed in your store, both enabled and disbled, including any custom addons ordered with [X-Cart WebDev](https://www.x-cart.com/ecommerce-development-services.html "Upgrade System Screen").
  
* **Purchases** : This section contains a list of purchased addons with a possibility to install or activate them.

The 2 sections that you will most frequently use when working with your store are **My Addons** and **Updates & Upgrades**.

The search bar allows finding a necessary addon by name through all the sections. Some of the addons require an exact matching to be found, so if no results are diplayed check for any typos in the addon name.
