Product reviews import feature is added by the free {% link "Product Reviews" ref_XBriIS6B %} addon. It is not included in the X‑Cart core.

A CSV file for importing reviews must have the name **reviews-yyyy-mm-dd.csv**, where the part **-yyyy-mm-dd** can be any date you want, or can be omitted.

Examples of correct product CSV file names:

* reviews.csv;
* reviews-13-01-01.csv;
* reviews-from-my-provider.csv

Below is a list of supported fields and their respective value types for the import of reviews:
