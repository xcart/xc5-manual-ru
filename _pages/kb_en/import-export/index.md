Data import is a perfect solution if you do not have the time or desire to populate your store with products and customers adding them manually one by one; it enables you to add new information and update the existing information about products, categories, users and other stuff by submitting a specially formatted data file. If necessary, it is even possible to import orders.

{% note info %}
If you want to add multiple changes to the products that already exist in the database, you may find it easier to use {% link "bulk editing" ref_1kSYmXQn %} instead.
{% endnote %}

For data import/export, X-Cart uses [CSV files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values "Import-Export"). Such files can be edited using any popular spreadsheet editor like MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc. 

Importing products is useful if you are switching to X-Cart from another platform, or if you want to make multiple changes to your products or inventory that are not possible with bulk editing. 

Similarly, if you have a customer list from another platfrom that you want to transfer to your X-Cart store, you can enter it into a CSV file and import this file via your X-Cart Admin area. You can also use a CSV template to build a new customer list.

The import of orders is suported via the [Orders Import](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/orders-import.html "Import-Export") addon. This addon can be installed as described in the section {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Data export is a convenient way to get structured information out of your X-Cart store. Typically, the function of data export is auxiliary - that is enabling you to find out the data format required to import data. For example, if you want to import a specific type of data, but do not know what fields need to be created in your import file and how the data in those fields has to be formatted, you can add just a couple of items of that type via the back end of your X-Cart store manually (or use the existing demo data) and then export it to CSV. This way you will have a pattern to follow when formatting the rest of the data to be imported into the store via CSV.
