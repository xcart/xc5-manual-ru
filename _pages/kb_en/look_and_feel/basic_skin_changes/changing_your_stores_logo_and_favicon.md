It is possible to add your own images for the store's logo and favicon:
![logo-favicon.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo-favicon.png)
 
It is also possible to change the store's "Apple icon". The icon is intended for mobile devices: it will appear on the home screen of a smartphone or tablet if a user pins your store to the home screen as their favorite site creating a shortcut (See [How to Add Websites to the Home Screen on Any Smartphone or Tablet](https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/ "Changing a Store Logo and Favicon") for more info.)

To change the store's logo, favicon or Apple icon images, you will need the **Simple CMS** addon by X-Cart team. Make sure this addon is installed and enabled at your store (If the addon is not installed, {% link "install and activate it" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}):

![simple-cms.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/simple-cms.png)

To change the default logo, favicon or Apple icon images for your store website:

1.  Prepare the custom images you want to use and store them on your local computer.

2.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Logo & Favicon section (**Look & Feel** > **Logo & Favicon**).
    
3.  Use the buttons to select the images you want to use instead of the ones used currently.
    ![logo-favicon-choose-file.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo-favicon-choose-file.png)

4.  Click **Submit** to save the changes. 
    ![logo-favicon-submit-logo.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo-favicon-submit-logo.png)

The selected custom image(s) will be uploaded and displayed on the Logo & Favicon page instead of the old one(s). 
    ![logo-favicon-new-logo.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo-favicon-new-logo.png)

Now your store visitors should be able to see the new image(s):
    ![logo-favicon-storefront.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo-favicon-storefront.png)
    
If necessary, after replacing the default image(s) with your own one(s), you can revert to the defaults by choosing the **Return to default logo** (**favicon**, **AppleIcon**) option:
    ![logo-favicon-return-default.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo-favicon-return-default.png)
