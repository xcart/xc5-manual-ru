It is possible to add your own images for the store's logo and favicon:
![logo_favicon1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo_favicon1.png)
 
It is also possible to change the store's "Apple icon". The icon is intended for mobile devices: it will appear on the home screen of a smartphone or tablet if a user pins your store to the home screen as their favorite site creating a shortcut (See [How to Add Websites to the Home Screen on Any Smartphone or Tablet](https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/ "Changing a Store Logo and Favicon") for more info.)

To change the store's logo, favicon or Apple icon images, you will need the addon **Simple CMS** by X-Cart team. Make sure this addon is installed and enabled at your store (If the addon is not installed, {% link "install and activate it" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}).

To change the default logo, favicon or Apple icon images for your store website:

1.  Prepare the custom image you want to use. If replacing the main store logo image, check the **Images** section (**Look & Feel** > **Images**) to find out the recommended store logo dimensions
for your store's skin/design theme. You will be able to upload a larger size image, but X-Cart will resize it to the specified dimensions.

2.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Logo & Favicon section (**Look & Feel** > **Logo & Favicon**).

3.  Click on the image you want to replace. From the menu, select the action you require and upload the image onto the store server. 
    For example, we are going to replace the X-Cart logo used by default with an image "My X-Cart Store" from our local computer:
    ![logo_favicon_setup1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo_favicon_setup1.png)

    Here we can see our image that has replaced the default logo:
    ![logo_favicon_setup2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo_favicon_setup2.png)
    
    It is possible to add alt text for the image using the text field that can be accessed by clicking "alt" on the respective image box.
    ![logo_favicon_setup3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo_favicon_setup3.png)

4.  Click **Submit** to save the changes. 

The changes will be saved and the selected custom image will be uploaded and displayed on the Logo & Favicon page instead of the old one. 
    ![logo_favicon_setup4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo_favicon_setup4.png)
    
Now your store visitors should be able to see the new image on the storefront. 
    ![logo_changed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/logo_changed.png)

If necessary, after replacing the default images with your own ones, you can revert to the defaults again. To do so, select the *Delete* option and click **Submit** to save the changes.
