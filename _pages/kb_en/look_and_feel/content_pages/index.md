Content and service pages like "Contact Us", "Terms & Conditions", "Maintenance", "Page not found" and others are pages with a static page content that serve to deliver important information to customers in a constant manner. Though all of these pages are similar in function they differ in implementation and maintenance.

Main, but not all, of the content pages are created and managed in the **Pages** section of the admin area (**Content** -> **Pages**), like the "Terms & Conditions" page.

"Contact Us" page is different and can be added and managed by the facilities of the {% link "Contact Us" ref_hfZXkxzT %} addon.

"Maintenance" and "Page not found" pages are service pages that can not be accessed through the store Admin area and can be changed either directly on the server or via the {% link "Webmaster Mode" ref_2Kfe2OX6 %} facilities.
