You can manange your store's design templates (skins) using the **Layout** section (**Look & Feel** > **Layout**) of the store Admin area.
![layout_section.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/layout_section.png)

If you visit this section, you will see that the upper part of the page shows the design template that is installed and active in the store currently. 
![current_template.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/current_template.png)

You can use the **Customize storefront** button to access some storefront customization settings.
![customize_storefront_button.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/customize_storefront_button.png)

For some skins you may also be able to edit custom options:
![edit_skin_custom_options.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/edit_skin_custom_options.png)

If you wish you can switch to using a different skin. All the skins available to you are shown in the **Choose a new template** section. The skin that is currently active in your store is highlighted with a green frame. To switch to a different skin, select the skin you require in the **Choose a new template** section (by clicking on the skin icon) and click the **Submit** button. 

You can purchase and download more skins from the X-Cart App Store. More info on this is available in the section {% link "Installing Skins from the X-Cart App Store" ref_2lgAqF3p %}.

You can disable or remove a previously installed skin by deactivating or uninstalling the respective addon via the **My addons** section.
