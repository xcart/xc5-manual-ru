You can find out what design templates (skins) are installed and available in your X-Cart store by using the **Layout** section (**Look & Feel** > **Layout**) of the store Admin area.
![layout_section.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/layout_section.png)

If you visit this section, you will see that the upper part of the page shows the design template that is installed and active in the store currently. 
![current_template.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/current_template.png)

You can use the **Customize storefront** button to access some storefront customization settings.
![customize_storefront_button.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/customize_storefront_button.png)

For some skins you may also be able to edit custom options:
![edit_skin_custom_options.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_GLqVdpgd/edit_skin_custom_options.png)

The current skin can be changed. All the skins available to you are shown in the **Choose a new template** section (the current skin is highlighted with a green frame). To change the skin, select a different skin (by clicking on it) and click the **Submit** button.
