X-Cart 5.3.x and earlier came with two pre-installed skins that a store administrator could choose from: Crisp White skin and Standard skin of 4 different color schemes. Starting from X-Cart 5.4.0.x Standard skin is deprecated in all color schemes and can be used continuously by the early adopters only. 

{% note warning %}
In case Standard skin is switched off in X-Cart 5.4.0.x and substituted with any other skin instead the changes can not be reverted.
{% endnote %}

If a default skin does not suit your business, it is possible to purchase and install a custom skin from the [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/). 
Instructions for that are available in the section {% link "Installing Skins from the X-Cart App Store" ref_2lgAqF3p %}.

In case you have more than one design theme installed at your store, you can change the theme your store is using by following the instructions from the section {% link "Changing Your Store Skin" ref_GLqVdpgd %}

All X-Cart skins, both the pre-installed ones and the ones you can purchase via the X-Cart App Store, use the standard left-to-right representation. If necessary you can convert a skin into a right-to-left one using the addon [RTL Languages Support](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/standard-rtl-skin.html). For more info on this addon, see the section {% link "RTL Languages Support" ref_3vEHzhPP %} of this manual.
