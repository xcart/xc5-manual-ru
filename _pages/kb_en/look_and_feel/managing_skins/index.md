If your store's default skin does not suit your business, it is possible to purchase and install a custom skin from the [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/). 
Instructions for that are available in the section {% link "Installing Skins from the X-Cart App Store" ref_2lgAqF3p %}.

If you have more than one design theme installed at your store, you can change the theme your store is using by following the instructions from the section {% link "Changing Your Store Skin" ref_GLqVdpgd %}

All X-Cart skins use the standard left-to-right representation. If necessary, we can help you customize your store to enable right-to-left representation. For more info, see the page [RTL Languages Support](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/standard-rtl-skin.html).
