Each X-Cart package comes with two pre-installed design templates that the store administrator can choose from: Crisp White skin and Standard. If none of them suits your business, it is possible to purchase and install a different skin from the [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/). 
Instructions for that are available in the section {% link "Installing Skins from the X-Cart App Store" ref_2lgAqF3p %}.

When you have more than one design theme installed at your store, you can change it following the instructions from the section {% link "Changing Your Store Skin" ref_GLqVdpgd %}

All X-Cart skins, both the pre-installed ones and the ones you can purchase via the X-Cart App Store, use the standard left-to-right representation. If necessary you can convert a skin into a right-to-left one using the addon [RTL Languages Support](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/standard-rtl-skin.html). For more info on this addon, see the section {% link "RTL Languages Support" ref_3vEHzhPP %} of this manual.
