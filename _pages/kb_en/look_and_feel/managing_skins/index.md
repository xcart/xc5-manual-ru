X-Cart offers two default skins - CrispWhite and Standard (deprecated in X-Cart 5.4.x) - and over [80 template add-ons](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/) that can be downloaded and installed from the Marketplace. The store admin area uses a default skin that can not be changed by the default means. As for the customer storefront you can change the skin used there depending on the impression you want your store to have on your customers.

{% note info %}
X-Cart 5.3.x and earlier supported the Standard skin in 4 different color schemes (Standard, Digital, Fashion and Noblesse) that are deprecated starting from X-Cart 5.4.0.x. 

X-Cart 5.4.x supports the CrispWhite skin that is a main skin and the Standard skin in Standard color scheme (deprecated) that will be completely removed from the software with time. 

For early adopters of the Standard skin in colour schemes other than Standard, the colour scheme used in the store before v5.4.0.x will be preserved as-is during the upgrade. Beware that in case a deprecated colour scheme is changed to any new skin in 5.4.x the changes can not be reverted. 
{% endnote %}

If a default skin does not suit your business, it is possible to purchase and install a custom skin from the [X-Cart App Store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/). 
Instructions for that are available in the section {% link "Installing Skins from the X-Cart App Store" ref_2lgAqF3p %}.

In case you have more than one design theme installed at your store, you can change the theme your store is using by following the instructions from the section {% link "Changing Your Store Skin" ref_GLqVdpgd %}

All X-Cart skins, both the default ones and those you can purchase via the X-Cart App Store, use the standard left-to-right representation. If necessary, we can help you customize your store to enable right-to-left representation. For more info, see the page [RTL Languages Support](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/standard-rtl-skin.html).
