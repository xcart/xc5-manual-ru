The [template store](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/) section of the X-Cart App Store offers over 70 design templates (skins) that you can obtain and use for your X-Cart store site.

You can access the template store at any time by clicking on the _Visit the template store_ link in the **Layout** section of your store's Admin area (**Look & Feel** -> **Layout**).

The steps involved in installing a skin from the X-Cart App Store are similar to the ones described in {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}. 

Before you start, you need to purchase the skin you require and make sure you have a license key code for it. Have this key code at the ready so you can copy and paste it when required.

To install the skin:

1. In your X-Cart store Admin area, go to the section **Layout** (**Look & Feel** -> **Layout**).

2. Click the **Activate purchased skin** button:

3. Enter your skin license key code into the appropriate field and click **Activate**:

   Provided that the submitted license key code is valid, X-Cart will start downloading the skin:

   Once the download process has been completed, the new skin will be added to the list of skins available for installation in your store. (You will see it in the section **Choose a new template**).
   
4. In the **Choose a new template** section, select the skin that you need to install and click **Submit**:
   ![submit-new-skin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2lgAqF3p/submit-new-skin.png)
   
   X-Cart will start installing the skin. The process is likely to take a few minutes. Take care not to close the page before the process has been fully completed.

   Once the skin installation has been completed, a confirmation message will be displayed at the top of the screen.

5. That is all. Your new skin has been installed.
