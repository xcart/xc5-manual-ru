Your X-Cart based store has two default menus that appear on every page: the primary (header) menu and the footer menu. You can edit and/or delete the default items of both primary and footer menus and add new new items instead as well as add a drop-down menu from any of the menu items in the primary menu.

## Primary Menu

The default primary menu is displayed as items across the width of the header. A customer may probably look at the primary menu of your store to find some information about your products and contact details, like a "Contact us" page.

A default store primary menu has six predefined menu items:
![540-primary-menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-primary-menu.png)

* **Home** : The main page of your online store.
* **Hot deals** : The menu item with a drop-down submenu. This is the place where your store visitors will find links to pages generated by such addons as {% link "Sale" ref_7tBJ8Yqo %}, {% link "Bestsellers" ref_5wAOub4C %} and {% link "Special Offers" ref_special_offers %}.
* **Shipping** : The page describing your store shipping policy and delivery options available.
* **New!** : The page that lists the new arrivals. The page contect is formed automatically based on the {% link "Product Advisor" ref_72asis58 %} addon settings. 
* **Coming soon** : The page that lists product that are scheduled to arrive. The page content is formed automatically based on the "Arrival date" set for products.
* **Contact us** : The page with your company contact information. More info about the page content see in {% link "Enabling the 'Contact Us' Form" ref_hfZXkxzT %}.

You can edit and/or delete the default menu items and add new ones instead as well as add a drop-down menu from any of the menu items in the primary menu. A drop-down menu is a sub-menu from the main menu item, and is usually displayed as a list of items connected to the main menu item. Drop-down menus are a good way of organizing similar items: groups of webpages, blog posts, store policies, products, or product categories. 

## Footer Menu

The footer menu is usually displayed as links across the width of the footer. A customer will probably look at your footer menu to find information about your store policies and sitemap.

The default Footer menu looks as follows:
![540-footer-menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-footer-menu.png)

## Primary and Footer Menu Maintenance

Both primary and footer menus are maitained in the **Content** -> **Menus** section of your store Admin area. This section allows to edit and/or delete the existing menu items as well as to add new items instead. 

Each menu consists of a list of the predefined menu items:
<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Primary menu page</b>![540-primary-adm.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-primary-adm.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Footer menu page</b>![540-footer-adm.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-footer-adm.png)</div>
</div>

{% note warning %}
In order to be able to edit existing or add new items to the primary and footer menu, make sure that the addon **Simple CMS** is installed and enabled. If not, {% link "install and activate it" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.
{% endnote %}

### Adding New Menu Items

To add a new item to one of your store's menus:

1.  Go to the Menus page (**Content > Menus**) in the store Admin area. Select the menu you want to add a new item to and choose the respective tab - **Primary menu** or **Footer menu**:
    <div class="ui stackable two column grid">
      <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Primary menu page</b>![540-primary-adm.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-primary-adm.png)</div>
      <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Footer menu page</b>![540-footer-adm.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-footer-adm.png)</div>
    </div>
    
    For example, we decided to add a new menu item to the Primary menu and chose the **Primary menu** tab.
    
2.  Click the **New item** button.
    ![540-new-item.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-new-item.png)
    
    A new empty entry will be added to the list. 
    
3.  Provide information about the properties of the item that you want to add to the menu:
    ![540-new-item-line.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-new-item-line.png)
    *   **Item name**: Name of the menu item as it will be displayed to users.
    <a id="menu-item-link"></a>
    *   **Link**: Address of the page to which the menu item will redirect the user. 
           Specify the address using one of the following:
           * Relative path (e.g. cart.php?target=checkout)
           * Absolute path (e.g. https:/<your_store_domain>/cart.php?target=checkout).
           * Page name value (a special code that represents a page name surrounded by curly brackets; can be used to link to the page without having to specify its relative or absolute path). The list of page name values currently supported by X-Cart is as follows:
             - {home}, 
             - {new arrivals}, 
             - {coming soon}, 
             - {sale}, 
             - {bestsellers}, 
             - {my account}, 
             - {contact us}, 
             - {auction}, 
             - {loyalty program}),
             - {special offers},
             - {brands},
             - {gift card}.

             Note that if you need to specify a link to an external resource, you must use the **http://** prefix. For example, to add a link to google.com, you will need to enter the link as `http://google.com/`.
        
     * **Visible for** : Specify the user level the menu item should be visible for. Select from the options available in the drop-down:
       * Any visitors
       * Anonymous users only
       * Logged in users only
     
4.  Click **Save changes**.
    ![540-add-new-item.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-add-new-item.png)

The menu item will be added. You should now be able to see it on the storefront.

Once a new menu item has been added you can move on and add drop-down submenus as described [below](https://kb.x-cart.com/look_and_feel/navigation/adding_new_items_to_your_stores_menus.html#editing-submenus "Default Menus"). 

### Editing Existing Menu Items

A store admin can edit each property of an existing menu including submenus and their properties as well as delete menu and submenu items.

#### Editing Menu Properties

When hoving a cursor over a line in the list of menus, a store admin can see highlighted the menu properties that can be edited. 
![540-edit-menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-edit-menu.png)

To adjust a property value it is necessary to:
1. Click on the field the needs to be edited;
2. Substitute the existing value with any new one valid for this field;
3. Click **Save changes**.

#### Editing Submenus

Submenus are the menus of a drop-down level from a main menu item. Submenus are maintained absolutely the same way the main menu items are. To check whether a main menu item has any subnemu items a store admin should refer to the **Submenu** column of a menu listing page:
![540-submenu-column.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-submenu-column.png)

The **Submenu** column can contain 2 possible values:

* **Add** : The value means that there are no menus of a dropw-down level for the menu. A store admin can add a new level of drop-down level by clicking the **Add** link.
  
  To add a new drop-down level for a menu:
  * Click on the **Add** link in the Submenu column of the main menu:
    ![540-submenu-add-link.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-submenu-add-link.png)
    This opens a new menu listing page one level down.
  * Click the **New item** buttom:
    ![540-submenu-new-item.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-submenu-new-item.png)
  * Specify the menu item properties the same way as described in [Adding New Menu Items](https://kb.x-cart.com/look_and_feel/navigation/adding_new_items_to_your_stores_menus.html#adding-new-menu-items "Default Menus");
  * Click **Save changes**.
  
* **N items** : The value means that a menu has "N" menu items of a drop-down level, where N refers to the actual number of items. A store admin can click the N items link to view and edit the submenu items. 

   To edit an existing submenu:
   1. Click on the **N items** link;
      ![540-submenu-n-items-link.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_BDykFBbw/540-submenu-n-items-link.png)
      This opens a submenu listing page one level down.
   2. Edit the submenu items the same way as described in [Editing Menu Properties](https://kb.x-cart.com/look_and_feel/navigation/adding_new_items_to_your_stores_menus.html#editing-menu-properties "Default Menus");
   3. Click **Save changes**.

#### Deleting Menus

If it is necessary to delete a menu item a store admin should click a **Trash** icon opposite the icone in question and then click **Save changes**. A store admin can delete several or all menu items at once.
