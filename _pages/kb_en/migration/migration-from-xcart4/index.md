## Introduction

This article describes how you can upgrade your existing X-Cart 4 store to X-Cart 5.

[General overview of upgrade options on x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/x-cart-migration.html).

Basically, you have three routes:
1. You can perform the upgrade yourself (DIY option);
2. You can hire X-Cart team to perform the upgrade for you (Professional and Custom options);
3. You can hire 3rd party to perform the upgrade for you (DIY option + whatever agreement you come up with 3rd party).

This article describes how one can perform the data migration process themselves using [X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html).

If you also need to transfer custom data and custom functionality, there is no guide for that. 
Custom functionality has to be re-implemented to X-Cart 5 and you can either do that yourself, hire 3rd party or [hire our development team](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html) for this task.

The same applies to the custom data.
