After putting X-Cart 5 as your production store, be sure to monitor its performance via [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) and [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).

Google Analytics will show you whether you have more, less or the same amount of traffic to your store. Using the Google Search Console you will be able to get reports about possible crawling errors that need to be addressed.

If you want our SEO specialist to make sure that everything is alright with your store after the migration, please [contact us](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html).
