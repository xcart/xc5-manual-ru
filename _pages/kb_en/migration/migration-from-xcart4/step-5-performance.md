Congratulations! You've launched your new X-Cart 5 based store!

However, it's no time to rest on your laurels. You need to do the final step of your X-Cart v4 store upgrade to v5 - the new X-Cart 5 store performance check-up.

Use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) and [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) to monitor traffic and possible crawling errors of your new X-Cart 5 store.

Google Analytics will show you whether you have more, less or the same amount of traffic to your store. Using the Google Search Console you will be able to get reports about possible crawling errors that need to be addressed.

If you need help, our SEO specialists are always ready to check whether everything is alright with the SEO ranks of your store after the migration. [Contact us](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html) any time you feel necessary.
