The short answer is no, but there are subtle details. There are three possible situations, how your X-Cart 4 and X-Cart 5 stores can be installed.

1. You install X-Cart 5 on the same server as X-Cart 4. In this case, everything will just work.
2. You want to install X-Cart 5 on another server (some test server, local machine, etc). If you transfer the entire X-Cart 4 store there, everything will work just fine as well. 

	To make X-Cart 4 transfer easier, you can only transfer X-Cart 4's database and the following directories to save you some time:
	- `<X-Cart>/images/`;
	- `<X-Cart>/skin/common_files/pages/`;
	- `<X-Cart>/files/`, if you have e-goods.


	Put the database to MySQL server and place these directories inside some folder that would 'pretend' being X-Cart 4 for our migration task.

3. If you want to install X-Cart 5 on a new server, but keep X-Cart 4 on the old one, it can still work. In this case, you need to:
	- make sure that the MySQL on X-Cart 4 server allows remote connections. Contact your hosting team about that, if you face any troubles;
	- set the _enable_copy_ext_images_ option in {% link "Migration Wizard's settings" ref_1IAKq4cq %} to 'true'.
