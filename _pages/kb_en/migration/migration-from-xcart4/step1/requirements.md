The addon [X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html) has the same {% link "system requirements as X-Cart 5" ref_VG5mIoLT#server-requirements %}, but since the addon runs resource-heavy processes, you need to make sure that the server will not time out them.

The way to set the server up will depend on the server engine.

{% toc Table of Contents %}

## Apache

The `TimeOut` setting must be set to 600 or greater value in the Apache config file, e.g.:
     
```TimeOut 600```

If `php.ini` has `safe_mode = on`, ensure that the `max_execution_time` setting is defined as 600 or greater, e.g: 
     
```max_execution_time = 600```

If `safe_mode = off`, no additional setup is needed. 

## nginx configuration

The `fastcgi_read_timeout` setting must be set to 600 or higher in the `nginx` config file, e.g.: 
     
```fastcgi_read_timeout 600;```

The `request_terminate_timeout` parameter must be set to 600 or higher in the `php-fpm` config file, e.g.:
     
```request_terminate_timeout = 600```

If `php.ini` has `safe_mode = on`, ensure that the `max_execution_time` setting is set to 600 or higher, e.g: 
     
```max_execution_time = 600```

If `safe_mode = off`, no additional setup is needed.

## Suhosin

If you are using [Suhosin PHP add-on](https://suhosin.org/stories/index.html "Step 1: System requirements") on your server, you need to specify the following settings in your `php.ini`:

```
[Suhosin]
suhosin.post.max_name_length = 512
suhosin.request.max_varname_length = 512
```
