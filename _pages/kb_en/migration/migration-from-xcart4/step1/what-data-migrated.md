<br />How to transfer user passwords:
<br />- If you are migrating from X-Cart 4.1.x-4.4.x, you need to specify blowfish key on Hence all user passwords are migrated safely providing that a valid Blowfish key is specified at the <a href="https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard/using_the_xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard.html#step-2---connect" target="_blank">Step 2 - Connect</a> of the migration wizard and passwords will be transferred properly;
<br />- If you are migrating from X-Cart 4.5.x and later, passwords will not work after the migration. In order to allow customers log in using old passwords, you need to install [Migration: Restore logins of X-Cart 4 users module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/xcart-4-login.html) from the marketplace and specify X-Cart 4 blowfish key inside its settings.
