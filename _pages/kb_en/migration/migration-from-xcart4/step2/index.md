The second step of your X-Cart v4 based store upgrade to v5 is initial data migration.

{% note warning %}
PREREQUISITES:

1. Make sure the migration environment is prepared as described in {% link "Step 1: Migration environment" ref_1C23rFdB %}.
2. Make sure a fresh X-Cart 5 software is installed as described in the {% link "Installation Guide" ref_VG5mIoLT %}.
{% endnote %}

Initial data migration is performed with the help of the  {% link "XC4 to XC5 Migration Wizard" ref_enOvcLbO %} that is installed on a fresh X-Cart 5 store. The data migration will cover all the data specified in the {% link "What data is migrated?" ref_32GoV7A0 %} guide of this manual.

If you have a large database and want to get an idea of how your data will fit into a new X-Cart 5 based store without migrating the entire database, you can run a quick demo migration.

All the data migration steps are described in details in the guides of this section.
