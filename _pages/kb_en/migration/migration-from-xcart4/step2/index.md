The second step of your X-Cart v4 based store upgrade to v5 is initial data migration.

To proceed with the initial data migration you should have the migration environment prepared as described in {% link "Step 1: Migration environment" ref_1C23rFdB %} and a fresh X-Cart 5 software installed as described in the {% link "Installation Guide" ref_VG5mIoLT %}.

If you have a large database and want to get an idea of how your data will fit into X-Cart 5 without migrating the entire database, you can run a quick demo migration.

All the data migration steps are described in details in the guides of this section.
