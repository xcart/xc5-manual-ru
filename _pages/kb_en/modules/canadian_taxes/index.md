The addon [Canadian Taxes](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/canadian-taxes.html "Canadian Taxes") is intended for businesses based in Canada, and is aimed at configuring taxes like GST, PST, QST or HST. 

This addon is similar to the addon {% link "Sales Tax" ref_7fGmqgPE %}, but it enables you to set up taxes only for Canadian provinces, and the tax names are GST/PST/HST/QST. The tax name to be shown to a customer is chosen automatically based on the customer's province.

To start using the addon "Canadian Taxes", ensure that it is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}Â in your store.
