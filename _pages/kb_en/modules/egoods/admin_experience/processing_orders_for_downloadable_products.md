## E-good Order Processing Routine
The store administrator can adjust the steps of the order processing routine for e-goods orders using the settings on the {% link "E-goods addon settings" ref_1dsuHf3i %} page:

   * The setting "Show only ESD related fulfilment statuses" can be used to limit the set of fulfilment statuses that should be used by the store. Due to the specifics of the electronic method of delivery of such goods to the buyer, any statuses pertaining to the packaging, handling and shipping of an order will not be applicable for e-goods. If all the products in the store catalog are e-goods (no tangible goods that require shipping), the store administrator may consider switching to the E-goods order fulfilment model with just three statuses (_New_, _Delivered_ and _Will not deliver_). More info on X-Cart order statuses can be found in {% link "Understanding X-Cart order statuses" ref_DkbTi1qJ %}.

   * The setting "Approve before providing access to download" can be used by the administrator to specify whether they want to include an additional step into their order processing routine for e-goods so they can review the order before the buyer gets their download link.
   
     If the administrator does not feel they will need to do a manual review of every order containing e-goods, they may choose to disable the option "Approve before providing access to download". In this case, a buyer who orders a downloadable product will get a download link for it as soon as the order has been paid for (technically, as soon as the order payment status has been set to _Paid_). The initial order fulfilment status in this case will be _New_. The store administrator will then be able to process the order the usual way, updating the order payment and fulfilment statuses as they require. For example, after completing all work on the order, the store administrator may choose to set the order fulfilment status to _Delivered_. 
    
     If, contrary to the above approach, the administrator wants to check into the details of every e-goods order they receive before allowing the buyer to download the product, they will need to enable the option "Approve before providing access to download". In this case, a buyer who orders a downloadable product _will not_ get the download link right away. The order will be automatically assigned the fulfilment status _Waiting for approve_:
   ![wfa_status.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3sGGx0lV/wfa_status.png)

   When the store administrator gets an order with the fulfilment status _Waiting for approve_, they will need to review it and decide whether they want to approve it. 
     
   To approve the order, the administrator will need to switch the fulfilment status of the order to any status other than _Will not deliver_. Provided that the order has been paid for (the order payment status is _Paid_), this will allow the buyer access to the download link. 
     
   If the administrator chooses not to approve the order, they will need to switch the fulfilment status of the order to _Will not deliver_. In this case the buyer will not get access to the download link. 

## Adjustment of E-good Availability to the Purchaser 
<a id="renew-egoods-access"></a>
In the store's Admin area, the order details page for orders containing e-goods has a special tab - _E-goods_. 
   ![order-details.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3sGGx0lV/order-details.png)

The controls available via this tab enable the administrator to check and, if necessary, update the status of the e-good dowloadable link. For example, the administrator can check whether the file is currently available for download by the buyer, or check the number of file download attempts left to the buyer or the amount of time left till the link expiration. The administrator can also use the buttons provided on the tab:
   * The button **Block** discontinues access to the file for the buyer.
   * The button **Renew** resets the e-good link TTL/available downloads number for the buyer. (The TTL and the downloads count for the link are re-adjusted automatically to the default values as specified on the {% link "E-goods addon settings" ref_1dsuHf3i %} page; the link is automatically re-sent to the buyer.)
