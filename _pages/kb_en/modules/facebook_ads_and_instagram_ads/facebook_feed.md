PREREQUISITES:
1. Make sure the Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads addon is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_7fTH58sR %}.

{% endnote %}

The Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads addon allows you to upload your product catalog to Facebook and then use this catalog to promote (NOT sell) goods via ads in both Facebook and Instagram. Catalog uploading is done with the help of a product feed generation in X-Cart.

## Product Feed Generation

Once the Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads addon is installed and {% link "configured" ref_7fTH58sR %} you can proceed to the product feed generation.

The addon activates a new setting **Add to Facebook product feed** for each of the products in your store's catalog. You will find it in the **Marketing** section of the product details page.

This setting is enabled by default, that means that all the products with the setting **Add to Facebook product feed** put on will be added to the product feed and uploaded to your Facebook Catalog automatically. If you want to exclude any of the products from being added to your Facebook feed make sure you disable the **Add to Facebook product feed** setting for this product beforehand.
  
To generate a feed:

1. On the Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads settings page in your store's Admin area (**Marketing** -> **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads** (in X-Cart 5.3.x and earlier the section name is **Sales Channels**)), click the **Generate Product Feed** button to get a link for uploading a product feed to your Facebook Catalog.

     <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>X-Cart 5.3.x and earlier</b>![generate-feed-new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/generate-feed-new.png)</div>
     <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>X-Cart 5.4.x</b>![540-generate-feed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1LQyHRCO/540-generate-feed.png)</div>
   </div>
   
   {% note info %}
   Use the {% link "Google Product Feed" ref_2gQBB6qM %} addon to expand the data values that are submitted to the feed. In case the Google Product Feed addon is installed and enabled and the hidden/global/class attributes are assigned to Google groups, the feed generated by the Facebook Adds & Instagram Ads addon will also include the hidden/global/class attribute values set up for the Google Product feed.
   {% endnote %}
   
   The system will take some time to generate a Product Feed URL depending on the overall store inventory. 

2. Once the process is completed, copy the _Product Feed URL_ that has been generated and paste it into a relevant field in your Facebook Business ccount when specifying a source of products for your [catalog](https://www.facebook.com/products/catalogs/new "Product Feed Generation and Upload to Facebook").

   {% note info %}
   The _Frequency of Product Feed renewal_ setting itself will not make renewals automatical. You will need to {% link "configure your server to run scheduled X-Cart tasks" ref_lLqNzAaq %} to facilitate automatic renewals.
   {% endnote %}
