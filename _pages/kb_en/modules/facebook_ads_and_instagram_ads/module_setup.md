General addon installation and activation instructions can be found in the section {% link "Managing addons" ref_gTOegEua %} of this manual.

Once the addon has been activated, a new section will become available in your store's Admin area: **Marketing** > **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads** (in X-Cart 5.3.x and earlier the section name is **Sales Channels**). 

Also, a new setting - **Add to Facebook product feed** - will be added for each of the products in your store's catalog. You will find it in the **Marketing** section of the product details page.
