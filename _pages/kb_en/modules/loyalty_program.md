Do you want to stimulate guest customers to register, or encourage product reviews and ratings, or even reward customers for purchases?

## Managing Your Loyalty Program 

The Loyalty Program can be managed in the **Discounts** > **Loyalty Program** section of the Admin back end. 

![report.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1Odyn6mT/report.png)

There you can check reports on the reward points redeemed in your store and see a number of unused points for all customers, see a sum of total discount given to your customers for the redeemed points and a number of customers with unused reward points. 

Also you can check the current Loyalty Program settings and change them if required. 

To manage the Loyalty Program representation in the store front-end enable the corresponding menu in the **Content** > **Menus** section of the admin back-end and **save** the changes.

![menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1Odyn6mT/menu.png)

The menu itself is added automatically after the Loyalty Program addon has been installed.

## Customer Experience

When the Loyalty Program addon is enabled, the store visitors and registered customers can see the reward points they will get for buying a product.

![home.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1Odyn6mT/home.png)

Also, they can see a Loyalty Program menu (if enabled) where they can get information on the Loyalty Program policy.

![details.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1Odyn6mT/details.png)

At checkout, registered customers can see the reward points they will earn with the order. Store visitors will be promted to register an account for the reward points to be added to the order.

![checkout.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1Odyn6mT/checkout.png)

Customers can also earn reward points by rating products or writing {% link "product reviews" ref_XBriIS6B %}  if this feature is enabled in the Loyalty Program settings. 

{% note info %}
Reward Points for product ratings and reviews can be promoted either on the Loyalty Program page or with the help of the [Pop-Up Anywhere](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/popup-anywhere.html "Loyalty Program") addon.
{% endnote %}

Reward points are credited to a customer's account when an order gets a 'Paid' {% link "status" ref_DkbTi1qJ %}. After that the customer can see available reward points on the **Account Details** page in the **Reward Points** tab. If the order is cancelled or refunded the related reward points are withdrawn from the customer's account.

![user-front-end.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1Odyn6mT/user-front-end.png)

The customer can also check the transaction history of reward points on this page.

At checkout stage, the maximum amount reward points is applied to the order automatically. A shopper will simply see the discount.

However, if a customer wants to change how many reward points must be applied, they should click the **Redeem your award points** link, specify needed number of points to be applied and confirm the choice by clicking **Redeem** button.

![checkout-redeem.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1Odyn6mT/checkout-redeem.png)

Reward points will be converted into a respective discount according to the Loyalty Program settings and will be withdrawn from the customer's account after the order is paid. 

A store admin can check and adjust the reward points balance of a customer with a comment for the adjustment (if required) on the user account details page in the _Reward Points_ tab (**Users** -> **User list**).
