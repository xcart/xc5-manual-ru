PayPal Checkout payment method in X-cart is an integration of PayPal Commerce Platform via [PayPal Checkout](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal.html "Setting Up PayPal Checkout") addon.

The PayPal Commerce Platform (PPCP) merges the following former PayPal payment solutions:
- PayPal Payments Standard
- PayPal Payments Advanced
- PayPal Payflow Link
- PayPal Express Checkout
- PayPal Credit
- PayPal Partner Hosted with PCI Compliance

With PPCP a best suitable payment method for each buyer is selected dynamically by a special payment button tech. No matter which payment method the buyer selects, all payments are received into one source, allowing for easy withdrawal and consolidated reporting.
