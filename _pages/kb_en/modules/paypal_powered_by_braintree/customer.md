When the PayPal Powered by Braintree Payment is enabled a customer can choose it at checkout to pay for the order. Braintree allows customers to submit the CC data directly on your X-Cart site and this data will be processed securely.

Also Braintree allows saving credit card tokens for further use and a customer can choose a saved card to pay the order:

Customers can manage their saved cards in the **Braintree credit cards** tab when logged in in the customer's account in the X-Cart storefront:
