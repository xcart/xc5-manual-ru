The X-Cart addon [Products Carousel](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/products-carousel.html "Products Carousel") can be used to enable a responsive and user-friendly product carousel for certain sections on the storefront (e.g. Bestsellers, Featured Products, New Arrivals, etc.) It is compatible with smartphones, tablets and desktop computers.

To install the addon, follow the instructions from {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

After the addon has been installed, proceed to the addon settings page to configure it.

On the addon settings page, you will find a list of sections for which the product carousel can be enabled:

   ![settings-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4yBBezmL/settings-page.png)

Choose the sections you require and specify the navigation method that you want to be used for them (pagination, "next-previous" arrows or both at the same time). Note that your choice of a navigation method will be applied to all the sections with product carousel enabled; it cannot be changed on a per section basis.

Be sure to submit your changes to make them active.

When the product carousel option is enabled for a section, the section will look as follows on the storefront:

   ![cus-pagination.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4yBBezmL/cus-pagination.png)

With the product carousel mode enabled, your customers will not need to scroll down the page to see all the products in the section. They will be able to use either the "previous-next" arrows or the pagination to view all the products in the same place.

The product carousel mode is also compatible with the "drag-n-drop a product to the cart" feature.
