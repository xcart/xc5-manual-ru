{% note info %}
The information in this section pertains to the _addon_ RTL Languages Support that used to be available for download through the X-Cart App Store, but not any longer. This is a legacy article, no longer supported.

Currently we can provide the functionality of RTL Language Support as a custom development service. More information is available here: 
**[RTL Languages Support](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/standard-rtl-skin.html "RTL languages support")** 
{% endnote %}

The addon **RTL Languages Support** adds a possibility for the whole site to be displayed right-to-left when a particular language is selected in the storefront.

You can use this addon to create your own RTL skin based on default X-Cart template.

The addon **RTL Languages Support** is fully compatible with the {% link "default X-Cart color schemes" ref_GLqVdpgd %}: Fashion, Digital, Noblesse, Standard, Crisp White and [F2 skin](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/f2.html#product-details-tab-description "RTL languages support"). And it is easy to fine-tune to work with custom skins.

The addon adds a special **RTL** checkbox to the **Languages** page in the Admin area (**Store setup** -> **Translations**):

![languages.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3vEHzhPP/languages.png)

By enabling the **RTL** checkbox for a language you make a store using one of the standard skins to be displayed right-to-left when this language is selected in the customer storefront:
