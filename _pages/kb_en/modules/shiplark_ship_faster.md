The addon **Shiplark: Ship Faster** for X-Cart 5 allows you to connect your X-Cart based store with Shiplark, a shipping solution by Webgility. Shiplark allows you to ship smarter and get your packages to customers faster. It runs on your PC and pulls orders from all your online stores so there's one place where you can automatically generate shipping labels, print customized packing slips, provide tracking information to your customers, and more. This solution supports all major shipping processors including FedEx, UPS, USPS by Endicia, Stamps.com and Express 1.
