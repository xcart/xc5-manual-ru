4.  To complete the integration of your X-Cart store with ShippingEasy, you will need access to both your X-Cart store's Admin area and your ShippingEasy account settings, so be sure to keep both sites open in your web browser tabs. 
    
    * For a production ShippingEasy account, to access your account settings, use the URL [https://app.shippingeasy.com/settings](https://app.shippingeasy.com/settings "https://app.shippingeasy.com/settings").
    * For a staging account -[https://staging.shippingeasy.com/settings](https://staging.shippingeasy.com/settings "https://staging.shippingeasy.com/settings"). 
5.  (_Skip this step if you have already configured your X-Cart store's settings in ShippingEasy during registration_) Add your X-Cart store to the list of stores in your ShippingEasy account:
    1.  In the **Settings** section of your ShippingEasy account, click on the **Stores** link under **Integrations**:

    2.  Click the "**+ Add New**" button on the right-hand side of the screen:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8224894/8355898.png)

        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8224894/8355899.png)

    3.  From the **Platform** drop-down box, select _X-Cart_. In the **Store URL** field below, enter your X-Cart store's URL.
    4.  Click **Save**.
    5.  Enter the required store settings and click **Save** at the bottom of the page. This creates an entry for your X-Cart store in your list of stores in ShippingEasy:

6.  Configure the ShippingEasy addon in X-Cart:
    1.  From the details of your X-Cart store in ShippingEasy (**Settings** > **Stores**), copy the Store API Key:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8224894/8355904.png)
    2.  Switch back to the browser tab where you are using X-Cart and paste the value you have just copied into the **Store API Key** field on the ShippingEasy module configuration page.
    3.  Back in the browser tab with ShippingEasy, click on the **Settings** tab, then click on the **API Credentials** link under **Account Settings**:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8224894/8355905.png)
        Your API Key and API Secret will be displayed:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8224894/8355906.png)
    4.  Copy and paste these values one by one into the **API Key** and **API Secret** fields on the ShippingEasy addon settings page in your X-Cart store.
    5.  If you are a third party developer using a staging ShippingEasy account, select the **Staging account** option on the ShippingEasy addon settings page in X-Cart. For production use, leave the**Staging account** check box unselected.
    6.  Click the **Apply changes** button at the bottom of the ShippingEasy addon settings page in X-Cart to save the module configuration.

    (X-Cart's general addon activation instructions can be found in the article {% link "Activating and Deactivating Addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}).

That is all. You have completed integrating your X-Cart store with ShippingEasy. The next step will be to {% link "map your X-Cart order statuses to order statuses in ShippingEasy" ref_o506IWMl %}, after which the addon will be fully ready to use.
