title: Converting Social Login Accounts into Regular Accounts
order: 400
published: false
---
A store admin can convert a customer profile created with the Social Login addon into a regular customer profile by forcing a customer to change password on the next log-in. Just enable the _'Require to change password on next log in'_ option in the user profile (**Users** -> **User list**) and the customer will see their login email and will have to reset the password for their customer account in your store.
