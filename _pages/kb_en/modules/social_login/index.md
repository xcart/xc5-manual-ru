The [Social Login](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/social-login.html "Social Login") addon for X-Cart 5 is a solution that allows your customers to sign in using their existing Facebook, Google or Apple accounts. With so many new sites emerging each week, some people are getting tired of creating new accounts for them all. By implementing an easy login flow for users with existing network accounts you lower the barrier for people to sign up on your store site and, as a result, get more customers.

The screenshots below show the social login widgets that are added to your store site once you configure Facebook, Google and Apple login. 
<div class="ui stackable three column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Customer registration form</b>![541-sign-up-form.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_IapN8lJ8/541-sign-up-form.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Customer sign-in form</b>![541-sign-in-form.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_IapN8lJ8/541-sign-in-form.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Checkout sign-in form</b>![541-checkout-sign-in-form.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_IapN8lJ8/541-checkout-sign-in-form.png)</div>
</div>

When a user clicks on any of the above for the first time, they will need to grant your store permission to access their basic Facebook, Google or Apple account info and email address. Once this has been done, the user will be able to sign in with a single click. Your X-Cart store creates an account for the email used to sign in.

If both Google and Facebook accounts use the same email, and a customer uses one of the networks to sign in, X-Cart registers it and will allow access from the same system only. The customer will not be able to sign in with the other network from now on.
