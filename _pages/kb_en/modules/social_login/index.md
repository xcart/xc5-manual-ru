The [Social Login](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/social-login.html "Social Login") addon for X-Cart 5 is a solution that allows your customers to sign in using their existing Facebook or Google accounts. With so many new sites emerging each week, some people are getting tired of creating new accounts for them all. By implementing an easy login flow for users of such popular social networks as Facebook or Google+ (and today almost everyone has an account with either one of them or both), you lower the barrier for people to sign up on your store site and, as a result, get more customers.

The screenshots below show the social login widgets that are added to your store site once you configure Facebook and Google Login. First, you get the identity provider icons on each page of your store:

Second, you get the **Sign in with Facebook** and **Sign in with Google** buttons in the Sign in popup:

and on the customer registration page:

When a user clicks on any of the above for the first time, he will need to grant your store a permission to access his basic Facebook or Google account info and email address. Once this has been done, the user will be able to sign in with a single click.

If both Google and Facebook accounts are assigned to one and the same email your store will create one customer account for both of them also assigned to this very email address. Regardless of whether a buyer uses his Google or Facebook account to sigh in next time he'll get the X-Cart store account data for that very email.

A store admin can convert a customer profile created with the Social Login addon into a regular customer profile by forcing a customer to change password on the next log-in. Just enable the _'Require to change password on next log in'_ option in the user profile (**Users** -> **User list**) and the customer will see his login email and will have to reset the password for his customer account in your store.
