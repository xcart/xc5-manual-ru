To create a new special offer using the addon **Buy X Get Y offer**, follow the steps below:

1. In your X-Cart store Admin area, go to the section 'Discounts: Special Offers'
   ![so_discounts_special_offers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5KycxjBU/so_discounts_special_offers.png)

2. From the **New offer** drop-down box, select the type of offer you would like to create: _'Buy N items Get M of them discounted/free'_ (Note that if you are using only the 'Buy X get Y' special offers addon, this will be the only option; any other options that you may find in this box pertain to special offers addons other than 'Buy X Get Y' and are outside the scope of the current article.)  Click the **Create** button.  
   ![so_buyX_getY_create_offer.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5KycxjBU/so_buyX_getY_create_offer.png)
   
   A new page will appear where you will be able to configure the settings of your special offer.

3. Go through all the settings on the page and configure the offer as you require. See further below for a detailed explanation of all the settings.
 
4. Click **Update** to save your changes. 

5. Make sure the offer is active and available to your customers. 


The settings that need to be configured for each offer are as follows:

**General settings**

* **Offer type**: The type of your offer as specified at the time of offer creation (cannot be changed).

* **Administrative name**: The name by which you will be able to identify this offer; the name specified here only appears in your store's Admin area (in the 'Discounts: Special Offers' section). 

* **Enabled**: Whether the offer is active and can be used by your customers. Unselect the check box if you do not want the offer to be activated immediately after saving.  

**Dates**

The settings in this section allow you to specify the offer start and end times and dates. If the dates are not set, the offer is treated as open-ended. 

**Conditions**

* **Number of items to buy**: The number of items or product units that a buyer needs to add to their shopping cart to become eligible for the current offer.

* **From these categories**: The categories from which the buyer needs to get the number of items specified above. Subcategories are marked with '---'. Hold Shift to select more than one category. 
For a store-wide special offer, no category selection needs to be made; in this case the offer will be applied to all your store's SKUs including any products on sale, products with volume discounts and so on. If a specific category is selected, the offer will count only the SKUs from the root of this category. To include SKUs from the subcategories as well, you will need to select the subcategories along with the main category.
