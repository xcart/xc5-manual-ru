After enabling the addon 'Buy X Get Y', in the 'Discounts: Special Offers' section of your X-Cart store Admin area you will find two pre-configured special offers:
   * Sample: Get 1 of every 3 items with 50% discount - an offer that makes X-Cart automatically check if an order contains 3 or more items from a defined subcategory and give the buyer a 50% discount off the cheapest item.
   * Sample: Get every second item for free - an offer that makes X-Cart automatically check if an order contains 2 items from a defined category and give the buyer a 100% discount off the cheapest item.

These offers provide examples of how special offers may work for you. You can remove them or adjust their configuration as you require. Detailed information on the management of special offers is available in the {% link "Managing Special Offers" ref_1eX1GC1r %} section of this manual.
