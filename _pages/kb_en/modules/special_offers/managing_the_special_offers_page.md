Your X-Cart store provides a special page for information about special offers:
```
https://<your-store-domain>/<xcart-folder>/?target=special_offers
```
You will need to enable the Special Offers panel in the 'Hot Deals' section on the home page. For this purpose go to the 'Content: Menus' section in the store Admin area and choose the hot deals available.
