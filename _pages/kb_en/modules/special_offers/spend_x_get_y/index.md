The addon [Special Offers: Spend X Get Y](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/spend-x-get-y.html) works with a cart subtotal and gives a customer a discount if a certain subtotal is met. Unlike regular discounts or sales the addon encourages customers to spend from a certain sum to win a price. The Spend X Get Y offer is especially good when you need to force sales regardless of particular SKUs.
