The addon [Square Payments](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/square.html "Square") provides an integration with Square, a PCI compliant payment solution. Square is compatible with all types of devices: desktop, tablet and mobile and also supports offline in-person payments.

Prior to configuring the Square Payments addon in the Admin area of your X-Cart based store, you'll need to sign up for Square to get and account that provides access to Square Developer Dashboard where you'll find all the necessary data for the addon configuration in your store admin.

1. To create an account with Square start with a regular [Square sign up](https://squareup.com/t/f_partnerships/d_partnerships/p_xcart/c_general/o_none/u_partnersite?route=signup "Square") link or use the **Start a Square account button** at [https://squareup.com/us/en](https://squareup.com/us/en "Square").

     Click **Continue** to do further.
   * Then you'll need to fill in the form with your business details (the form and fields to fill in differ depending on a particular country requirements).

     {% note info %}
     If you already have an account with Square sign in to access your Square Seller Dashboard.
     {% endnote %}

2. When the account creation is completed or when signed in you'll see your Square Seller Dashboard. Here you need to go to the **Apps** -> **My Apps** section to get access to your Developer Dashboard.
   ![square-client-dashboard.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/square-client-dashboard.png)
   * Click on **My Apps** in the **Apps** section:
     ![apps-my-apps.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/apps-my-apps.png)
     You'll see a new screen with a list of apps connected. 
   * Click the **Go to Developer Dashboard** button to be redirected to your developer dashboard. 
     ![go-to-developer-dash.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/go-to-developer-dash.png)
     Square Developer Dashboard is opened in a new tab. 

4. Click the **Create Your First Application** button (or **New Application**, if you already have some existing apps connected):
   ![create-app.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/create-app.png)
   
   * Name your application and agree to the Square Developer Terms of Service:
     ![new-application.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/new-application.png)
   * Click **Create Application** to complete the step.

5. Now you are inside the application and can get access to the data required to configure Square Payment in your store.
  
   To make the application work with your X-Cart based store switch the application API Version to 2019-02-13 on the **Credentials** page:
   * Scroll down the page to locate the **API Version** section:
     ![change-api-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/change-api-1.png)
   * Click on the **Change Version** button and choose v. **2019-02-13** in the drop-down:
     ![change-api-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/change-api-2.png)
   * If you want to test the payment integration first, leave the application in **Sanbox Mode**. To accept live payments you'll need to switch it to **Production**:
     <div class="ui stackable two column grid">
       <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Sandbox Mode ON</b>![sandbox.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/sandbox.png)</div>
       <div class="column" markdown="span"><b>Production Mode On</b>![production.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/production.png)</div>
     </div>
     
6. Do not close the Square Developer Dashboard as you'll need to copy the application details to assign it to your X-Cart store.

## Order Processing Workflow

Square payment integration allows a store admin to choose whether a payment should be captured automatically or should be authorized first. By default all payments are set to pre-authorization by a store admin.

The payment auto capture can be enabled in the **Payment configuration** tab of the Square payment settings page in the store Admin area:
![payment-configuration.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/payment-configuration.png)

Set the **Auto capture** setting value to **Yes** and click **Submit** to save the changes. 

The **Payment configuration** tab of the Square payment settings page also allows to enable logs recording for all Square related operation. Set the **Enable debug** setting to Yes for this ourpose and click **Submit** to save the changes. All logs will be stored to the **System tools** -> **System logs** section of your store Admin area. Square logs will have the square-debug.log.YYYY-MM-DD.php or square-error.log.YYYY-MM-DD.php format.

When an order is paid with Square payment it is registered in the **Orders** -> **Orders list** section of your store Admin area. 

If Square payment is configured to payment authorization the orders will have the 'Authorized' payment status and 'New' fulfilment status by default.

![order-auth.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/order-auth.png)

To process an order it will be necessary to click either the **Capture** button to accept the payment (the order status will be changed to **Paid**) or the **Void** button to reject the payment (the order status will be changed to **Cancelled**).

If Square payment is configured to capture payments automatically the orders will have the 'Paid' payment status and 'New' fulfilment status by default.

![order-paid.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5kZcVsK7/order-paid.png)

A store admin can refund or partically refund a paid order by specifying the amount for refund in a special field on the order details page and clicking the **Refund**  button. The order will get the **Refunded** status in case of a full refund and **Partially paid** status in case of a partial refund.
