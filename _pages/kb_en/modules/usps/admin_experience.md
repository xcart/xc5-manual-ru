If U.S.P.S. delivery is set up via Pitney Bowes services, a store admin can create shipments to get an order tracking number and shipping label to attach them to the order. 

First of all, a store admin should open the order details page (**Orders** -> **Orders list**) and locate the _USPS shipments_ tab there:

The USPS shipments tab allows the store admin to specify the shipment details and, if required, to add extra shipping options.
