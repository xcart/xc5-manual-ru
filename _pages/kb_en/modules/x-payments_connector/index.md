The **X-Payments v1.x-3.x connector** addon for X-Cart 5 connects your X-Cart 5 based online store to [X-Payments](https://www.x-payments.com/help/Main_Page) for PCI compliant credit card processing. It is intended for use with X-Payments versions v1.x-3.x (_not_ compatible with X-Payments Cloud).

You can find out whether the X-Payments v1.x-3.x connector addon is installed and enabled in your X-Cart 5 store by checking the section **My addons** of your X-Cart store Admin area:

If the addon is not installed, you can obtain it from the X-Cart App Store. To intall the addon, follow the directions from the section {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.
 
**Important**: Please be aware that the X-Payments v1.x-3.x connector for X-Cart 5 has no support for the addon {% link "Not Finished Orders" ref_7dKyzAJ4 %}; for this reason, regardless of the addon settings, not finished orders will not be created when payment is made via X-Payments.

To connect your X-Cart 5 store to X-Payments v1.x-3.x using the connector addon, you will need to complete the following steps:

   1. {% link "Configure the connection in the X-Payments back end" ref_q4dUBnZT %}.
   2. {% link "Configure the connection in the Admin area of your X-Cart 5 store" ref_TIExeDzi %}.

A video guide for connecting X-Cart and X-Payments 3.x is available:
