The **[X-Payments Cloud connector](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/x-payments-cloud.html)** addon for X-Cart 5 connects your X-Cart 5 based online store to [X-Payments Cloud](http://www.x-payments.com/) for PCI compliant credit card processing. It is intended for use with X-Payments Cloud (_not_ compatible with X-Payments v1.x-3.x).

You can find out whether the X-Payments Cloud connector addon is installed and enabled in your X-Cart 5 store by checking the section **My addons** of your X-Cart store Admin area:
