The **[X-Payments Cloud connector](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/x-payments-cloud.html)** addon for X-Cart 5 connects your X-Cart 5 based online store to [X-Payments Cloud](http://www.x-payments.com/), a PSD2/SCA ready & PCI Level 1 certified payment service for secure credit card processing & storage in online shops. Note that the addon is intended specifically for X-Payments Cloud and is _not_ compatible with X-Payments v1.x-3.x.

You can find out whether the X-Payments Cloud connector addon is installed and enabled in your X-Cart 5 store by checking the section **My addons** of your X-Cart store Admin area:

If the addon is not installed, you can obtain it from the X-Cart App Store.

To install the addon, follow the instructions from the section {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Once the X-Payments Cloud connector addon has been installed and enabled, you can connect your store to X-Payments Cloud with it.

Please be aware that to use X-Payments Cloud with your X-Cart store you will need an X-Payments Cloud account. That is different from an X-Payments account for use with X-Payments v1.x-3.x. If you do not yet have an X-Payments Cloud account, you will be able to create one right from the connection page in your X-Cart store Admin area.

To configure the connection, follow the steps below:

1. In your X-Cart 5 store Admin area, go to the X-Payments Cloud connection settings page. This can be done using one of the following methods:
    
   * Go to the section **My Addons**, find the installed addon X-Payments Cloud connector and click on the **Settings** link pertaining to it.

   Or:
   
   * Go to the Payment settings page (**Store setup** > **Payment methods**) and choose to configure the payment method "X-Payments Cloud":
