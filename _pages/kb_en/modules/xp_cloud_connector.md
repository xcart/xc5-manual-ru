The **[X-Payments Cloud connector](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/x-payments-cloud.html)** addon for X-Cart 5 connects your X-Cart 5 based online store to [X-Payments Cloud](http://www.x-payments.com/), a PSD2/SCA ready & PCI Level 1 certified payment service for secure credit card processing & storage in online shops. Note that the addon is intended specifically for X-Payments Cloud and is _not_ compatible with X-Payments v1.x-3.x.

You can find out whether the X-Payments Cloud connector addon is installed and enabled in your X-Cart 5 store by checking the section **My addons** of your X-Cart store Admin area:

If the addon is not installed, you can obtain it from the X-Cart App Store.

To install the addon, follow the instructions from the section {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Once the X-Payments Cloud connector addon has been installed and enabled, you can connect your store to X-Payments Cloud with it.

Please be aware that to use X-Payments Cloud with your X-Cart store you will need an X-Payments Cloud account. That is different from an X-Payments account for use with X-Payments v1.x-3.x. If you do not yet have an X-Payments Cloud account, you will be able to create one right from the connection page in your X-Cart store Admin area.

To access the connection page, use one of the following methods:

   * Go to the section **My Addons**, find the installed addon X-Payments Cloud connector and click on the **Settings** link pertaining to it.

   Or:
   
   * Go to the Payment settings page (**Store setup** > **Payment methods**), locate the payment method "X-Payments Cloud" and choose to configure it:
     ![xp_cloud_method_configure_button.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_729XUzDQ/xp_cloud_method_configure_button.png)
     
The connection page looks like the following:
     ![xp_cloud_connector_settings1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_729XUzDQ/xp_cloud_connector_settings1.png)

Once you are ready to proceed with the connection, you will need to either create a new X-Payments Cloud account or to provide the connection details for your existing X-Payments Cloud account.

   * If you do not have an existing X-Payments Cloud account, choose to create one:

     1. In the field **Your email**, specify the email address that you are going to use for the X-Payments Cloud account administrator. 
     
     2. In the field **Account name**, specify your desired account name.
     
     3. After completing the above fields, click **Create account**.
   
     This will create an X-Payments Cloud account for you and start your trial period. No commitment and no credit card are required during the trial period.

   * If you already have an existing X-Payments Cloud account:
     
     1. Use the link "If you already have an X-Payments account, please click here" in the lower part of the page to access the X-Payments Cloud account sign-in page:
        ![access_signin_4registered.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_729XUzDQ/access_signin_4registered.png)
   
     2. On the page that opens, enter your account name and click **Connect**:
