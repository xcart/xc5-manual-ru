The **[X-Payments Cloud connector](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/x-payments-cloud.html)** addon for X-Cart 5 connects your X-Cart 5 based online store to [X-Payments Cloud](http://www.x-payments.com/), a PSD2/SCA ready & PCI Level 1 certified payment service for secure credit card processing & storage in online shops. Note that the addon is intended specifically for X-Payments Cloud and is _not_ compatible with X-Payments v1.x-3.x.

Please be aware that to use X-Payments Cloud with your X-Cart store you will need an X-Payments Cloud account. That is different from an X-Payments account for use with X-Payments v1.x-3.x. If you do not yet have an X-Payments Cloud account, you will be able to create one right from the connection page in your X-Cart store Admin area.
