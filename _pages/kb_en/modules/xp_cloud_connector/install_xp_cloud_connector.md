You can find out whether the X-Payments Cloud connector addon is installed and enabled in your X-Cart 5 store by checking the section **My addons** of your X-Cart store Admin area:
![xpc_connector_myaddons.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2BXoj25Y/xpc_connector_myaddons.png)

In that section, type "cloud" or "x-payments" in the search box and hit Enter; as a result, you will be provided with a list of search results including the card of the X-Payments Cloud connector addon. The card will show the current status of the addon. 

On a new X-Cart trial, the status will typically be shown as "Enabled". It means that the addon is already installed and ready to use:
![xpc_connector_enabled.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2BXoj25Y/xpc_connector_enabled.png)

If, however, the addon is not installed in your store for some reason, you will need to install it from the X-Cart App Store. To install the addon, follow the instructions from the section {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

After making sure the X-Payments Cloud connector addon has been installed and enabled, you can use it to {% link "connect your store to X-Payments Cloud" ref_4kjOv7Ne %}.
