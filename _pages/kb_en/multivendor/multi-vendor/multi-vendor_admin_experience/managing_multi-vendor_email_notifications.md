order: 250
published: true
---
The addon **Multi-vendor** enables its own set of email notifications in X-Cart. The store administrator should check and adjust these notifications in the Email notifications section (**Store setup** > **Email notifications**). More information on the management of X-Cart store notifications is available in the section {% link "eMail Notifications: Set Up and Maintenance" ref_5QLrLCu7 %}.

The notifications pertaining to **Multi-vendor** include the following:


* _Notifications related to the management of vendor accounts:_

     * **Vendor account created**: This notification is sent when a new vendor account is created.
   
     * **Vendor account approved**: This notification is sent after a new vendor account is approved by the store administrator.
    
     * **Vendor account rejected**: This notification is sent after a new vendor account is rejected by the store administrator.


* _Order related notifications for vendors:_

    * **Order changed with advanced order management (for vendor)**: This message is sent to notify the vendor of any changes made to their order by an administrator using the advanced order management feature.
   
    * **Order canceled (for vendor)**: This notification is sent to the vendor when an order gets the status Canceled.
   
    * **Order changed (for vendor)**: This notification is sent to the vendor when the status of an order is updated - in the event that no other type of notification is sent.
   
    * **Order created (for vendor)**: This notification is sent to the vendor when a new order is created (Disabled by default).
   
    * **Order failed (for vendor)**: This notification is sent to both the administrator and customer when an order gets the status Declined.
   
    * **Order processed (for vendor)**: This notification is sent to the vendor when an order gets the status Paid.
   
    * **Customer has rated the order (for vendor)**: This notification is sent to the vendor when a customer rates the order of this vendor.
    
    * **Backordered item in the orders** (for vendors): This notification is sent to a vendor if one or more products of this vendor in a customer's order are out of stock at the time of order placement (available starting from X-cart 5.4.1.x).


* _Payout request related notifications:_

    * **Vendor request for payment**: This message is used to notify the administrator when a vendor submits a payout request.
   
    * **Vendor request has been processed**: This message notifies the vendor who has submitted a payout request as to whether their payout request has been approved or declined by the administrator.


The store administrator should also check the E-Mail transfer settings section (**Store setup** > **Email notifications**) and properly specify the REPLY-TO email address that should be used for email notifications that will be sent to the vendors. This can be done by adjusting the setting **Email to use for the REPLY-to field in vendor email**.
