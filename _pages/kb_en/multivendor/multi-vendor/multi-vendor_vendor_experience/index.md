In this section, you will find instructions for using the features and functions of a Multivendor X-Cart store as a vendor. 

{% note info %}
By “vendor” we mean a marketplace vedor/seller/merchant or an agent acting on their behalf and represented by an X-Cart store user with the access level “Administrator” and the role “Vendor”. Vendors are allowed to log in to the store's back end, but have access only to a limited set of features (This is called a "Vendor area").
{% endnote %}

A vendor is responsible for their part of store configuration and maintenance which they work on via the so-called "Vendor area". The scope of features and functions available to them depends on the Multivendor mode enabled for the store by the administrator.
