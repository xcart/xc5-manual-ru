Vendors can use the Import by CSV section of the store's back end  (**Catalog** > **Import**) to add their new products and update their existing products.

They can also export their existing products to CSV via the Export in CSV section (**Catalog** > **Export**).

The process of product import and export for vendors is exactly the same as for the store administrator.

The only thing that makes product import and export different for a store with vendors compared to a store without vendors is that information about the product owner is included into the CSV file with product data. This is done using the column **vendor** which provides the email address of the vendor who created the product.

The **vendor** column is present in all product export CSV files, no matter whether they are created by the store administrator or by a vendor. However, a vendor can export only their own products, which means the export CSV file for them contains only their own products and their own vendor email address. 

Using the **vendor** column in the import CSV file is not mandatory: even if a vendor uploads a CSV file with vendor information omitted, the products being imported will still be identified as owned by this vendor.
