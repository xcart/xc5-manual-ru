X-Cart **Multivendor** edition is X-Cart Business extended with a bunch of Multivendor-specific addons. These addons modify a regular X-Cart Business store transforming it into a marketplace that can be used simultaneously by multiple sellers. 

The most important addon of this bunch is [**Multi-vendor**](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/suppliers-multivendors.html "Multivendor Components"). It is the core of the Multivendor package; you won't be able to run a Multivendor marketplace without it. This addon introduces a new type of X-Cart users - "vendors", an interface for vendor registration and approval, an option for the store administrator to choose one of two store operation modes (Warehouse/Vendors as separate shops), a dedicated area of the store back end where vendors can manage their product catalog and get access to orders, payment transactions and statistics, and so on.

There are also a few other addons recommended for use with X-Cart Multivendor. Some of them are strictly specific to the Multivendor package because they depend on the core Multi-vendor addon and cannot be used without it (like **Trusted/Non-trusted vendors**). Others are addons that have Multivendor related features (like **Order messages**). You are not required to have all these addons installed and enabled in your store; just choose the ones you require for your business. 

Here's a brief overview of the addons typically used to build a Multivendor store (in addition to the addon **Multi-vendor**):

   * **[Trusted/Non-trusted vendors](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/trusted-vendors.html)**: This addon enables the store administrator to mark vendors as trusted and non-trusted. Any products added by vendors with the status "Trusted vendor" will be visible to your store visitors right away, whereas the products of non-trusted vendors will appear on the storefront only after they have been approved by the administrator. For more information on this addon, see {% link "Trusted/Non-trusted Vendors" ref_5c7BY9Rn %}.

   * **[Multiple Profiles for Vendors](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/multiple-profiles-for-vendors.html)**: The addon enables existing vendors to create additional user profiles for the staff who help them work on their product catalog, promotions and orders. For more information on this addon, see {% link "Multiple Profiles for Vendors" ref_3le6s8jL %}.
     ![mvp_module.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_MRQEvicQ/mvp_module.png)

   * **[Messages](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/order-messages.html)**: This addon is not just for Multivendor; it can be used on single-seller X-Cart editions just as well. We are listing it here because it provides some Multivendor-specific features when used with the X-Cart Multivendor edition. This addon enhances the communication system in your store by providing an opportunity for the customers, the store administrator and the vendors to start a conversation or dispute about an order right from the Order details page. A well-thought-out notification system ensures that no message will be left unread. In Multivendor, the addon also allows store visitors to start messaging with the sellers before they make a purchase; they can initiate a conversation right on the sellers' pages on the storefront.
