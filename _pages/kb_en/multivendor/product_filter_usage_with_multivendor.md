In a Multivendor X-Cart store with the addon **[Product Filter](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/product-filter.html)** installed and enabled, store visitors can filter the products on the storefront by vendor. The filter is provided on the pages of catgories containing products of more than one vendor:

More info on using the addon Product Filter is available in the {% link "Product Filter Addon" ref_6e82A7rL %} section of this manual.

If you wish to use the addon Product Filter, but would prefer not to allow your store site visitors to user the filtering by vendor, you will need to disable the setting **Show vendor list in product filter** on the "Multi-vendor" settings page:
