In a Multivendor X-Cart store with the addon [Sale](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/sale.html "Sale: Usage with Multivendor") installed and enabled, a vendor can manage a sale offer if a special permission is set for the offer by a store administrator.

Basic usage of the Sale addon is described in the main {% link "Sale Addon" ref_7tBJ8Yqo %} manual, so here we will just go over the multivendor-related specifics.
