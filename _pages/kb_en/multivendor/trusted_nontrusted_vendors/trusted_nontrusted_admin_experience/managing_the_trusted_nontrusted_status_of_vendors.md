The store administrator can mark vendors as trusted or non-trusted. Any products added by trusted vendors will become visible on the storefront right away (no need for approval by the store administrator). Products added by non-trusted vendors will have to be reviewed and approved by the store administrator before they get published.

Before a seller is given the status of a "Trusted vendor" by the store administrator, their status is "Non-trusted vendor". To mark a vendor as trusted, the store administrator must review their profile and set the required status "Trusted vendor" via the **Trusted vendor** field on the "Company details" page of a vendor profile:

The status of a vendor can be reset to "Non-trusted vendor" at any time should the store administrator require to do so.
