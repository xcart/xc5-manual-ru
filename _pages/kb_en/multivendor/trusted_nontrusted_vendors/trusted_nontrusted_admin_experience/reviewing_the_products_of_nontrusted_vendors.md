After a non-trusted vendor submits a new product for approval by the store administrator, the store administrator is notified about the fact via the notification section on the store homepage:
![541-trusted-vendors-unapproved-products-notification.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5G96zfLj/541-trusted-vendors-unapproved-products-notification.png)

(The words "Unapproved products N" are a link which the store administrator can use to quickly access the list of products sent for approval; N is the number of products for review.)

The store administrator can use the "Unapproved products N" link in the notification or go to the product listing page of the store Admin area (**Catalog** -> **Products**) and {% link "use filtering" ref_3ge43cA0 %} to find products in the "Sent for approval" state.

To approve or decline the publication of a product, the store administrator needs to open the product for viewing/editing; then they need to use the **Approve** or the **Decline** button according to what action they require.

* If the administrator chooses to approve the publication of the product, a popup titled "Approve and add comment" will be displayed:
  ![541-trusted-vendor-approve-product.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5G96zfLj/541-trusted-vendor-approve-product.png)

   To approve the publication of the product, the store administrator will need to click the **Approve product** button. Leaving a comment for the vendor is optional. 

* If the administrator chooses to decline the publication of the product, a popup titled "Decline and add comment" will be displayed:
  ![541-trusted-vendors-decline-product.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5G96zfLj/541-trusted-vendors-decline-product.png)

  To decline the publication of the product, the store administrator will need to click the **Decline product** button. Leaving a comment for the vendor is optional. 

Approving or declining the publication of a product triggers an {% link "email notification" ref_2x7CPLIC %} to the vendor to notify them of the product status change. If the administrator has chosen to leave a comment, the comment is sent to the vendor along with the email notification.
