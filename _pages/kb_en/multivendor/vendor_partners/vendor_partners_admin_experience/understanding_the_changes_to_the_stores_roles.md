After the activation of the addon **Multiple profiles for vendors**, the administrator will find a new role added to the list of user roles in the Roles section of the store's Admin area (**Users** > **Roles**) - the role "Vendor staff":
![541-mpfv-roles-vendor-staff.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2ds6Cj75/541-mpfv-roles-vendor-staff.png)

This role corresponds to a set of access permissions that enable a user to access the working area of a specific vendor and perform operations in that area on behalf of the vendor. The exact scope of access permissions that a user with this role gets (full or limited) is defined by the vendor. 

Note that being the primary feature of the addon, the role "Vendor staff" may not be removed. If necessary, however, the store administrator can rename it:
