To create a new vendor staff profile, a vendor needs to be logged in to their personal Vendor area. The creation of a new vendor staff account can be initiated from the Vendor staff members section (**My account** > **Staff members**):
![541-vendor-add-staff-member-button.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_61myPZQD/541-vendor-add-staff-member-button.png)

In that section, the vendor needs to click the **Add staff member** button and specify an email in the new blank field that opens.

This needs to be a valid email address of a  person who needs to be given vendor staff access as it will be used to send an invitation to the user with a link for access to the vendor area; the user will have to use that link to complete the sign up to their profile as a staff member.

Before saving the new user profile, the vendor also needs to set the desired access level for the user by adjusting the **Full access** toggle for a profile. For more info on vendor staff access levels, see the section {% link "Multiple profiles for vendors: Staff member access levels" ref_2RWVrO1D %} of this manual.

If necessary, the vendor can add more than one staff members at once: every click of the **Add staff member** button creates an additional blank line for a new vendor staff member profile.

After adding the staff email address(es) they require and setting the access level(s), the vendor needs to click the **Save changes** button. This will create the new vendor staff profile(s).

Once a user profile for a new vendor staff member has been created, the vendor needs to {% link "send them an invitation" ref_0wN2KuZB %} so they can log in to the Vendor area, confirm their staff status and begin their work.
