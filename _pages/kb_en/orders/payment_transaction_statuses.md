Every order in your X-Cart store has a payment transaction status that provides information as to the current state of the payment in the cart processing workflow. 

{% note info %}
A payment transaction is not a bank transaction in its actual meaning. A payment transaction is created at the moment a customer intends to place an order using both offline and online payment methods. The difference is in the order. 

For **offline payments** an order is created when the _Place Order_ button is clicked, transaction getting a "Pending" status automatically. 

For **online payments** in case of a successfull payment X-Cart Admin area registers an order with a "Success" payment transaction status. In case of a failed payment an order is not created, but a transaction is registered with a "Failed" status. A cart is not frozen at the moment of a failed payment and a customer can update it further. If you want a cart to be frozen at the moment of a failed transaction, please, use the addon {% link "Not Finished Orders" ref_5TMbPwNQ %}.
{% endnote %}

By default, X-Cart uses the following payment transaction statuses:

{:.ui.compact.celled.small.padded.table}
| In progress | The cart payment has been initiated by a customer (a customer clicked the 'Place Order' button and started submitting cc data info).|
| Success | The order is successfully paid. Money has been transferred. |
| Pending | The order payment is under consideration. (Used by default for offline payment methods) |
| Failed | An attempt to authorize or charge the customer’s card has failed. Failure is generally due to technical or temporary reasons.|
| Canceled | The order is canceled by a merchant. The payment refunded to a customer in full. |
| Void | A credit card purchase that a merchant cancels after it has been authorized but before it has been settled. A void transaction does not appear on the customer’s credit card statement, though it might appear in a list of pending transactions when the customer checks their account online. |

{% note info %}
Each failed transaction has a 'Details' note that clarifies the cause of the failure.
{% endnote %}

A cart admin can find the info on the payment transaction statuses in the _**'Payment transaction'**_ section of the admin back-end (**Orders** > **Payment transactions**).

The page supports orders search based on a payment transaction status as well as order number, date and public id.

The information that displays for a transaction on the transaction listing page is as follows:

* **Public ID** : A unique alpha-numeric identifier of a transaction generated by bank. A transaction ID is needed when you search for a particular payment or issue a refund. This one also can be used to authenticate the holder of the card before reporting the data about the payments of a particular customer.
* **Order** : The order number a payment transaction refers to.
* **Customer** : The name of a customer who made a transaction.
* **Date** : The date and time of a transaction.
* **Method name** : A payment method used to place an order in your store.
* **Type** : The type of a transaction.
* **Status** : The status of a payment associated with each transaction, which tells you where in the process the transaction is currently. 
* **Value** : The amount of money involved in a transaction. 

Transactions can be sorted for display in the table by "Public ID", "Order", "Date", "Type", "Status" and "Value". Click the column heading to change the order hierarchically.
