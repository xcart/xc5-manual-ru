To accept payments from buyers, you need to enable one or more payment methods for your store. Payment methods are managed via the **Payment methods** section (**Store setup > Payment methods**):

The Payments methods section allows you:

*   {% link "Viewing Your Store's Payment Methods List" ref_0wA82ctg %}
*   {% link "Adding Payment Methods" ref_36BqwVSF %}
*   {% link "Managing Your Existing Payment Methods" ref_25BG59R3 %}
