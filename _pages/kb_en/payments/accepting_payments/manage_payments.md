After a payment method is added to the list of available, a store admin can edit it if it is necessary to e.g. change the payment configuration settings, disable or completely delete this payment from the list.

{% note info %}
If you need to change the order the payments are displayed in the storefront, see {% link "Sorting payments on the storefront" ref_1WSCwpNh %}.
{% endnote %}

## Editing Existing Payment Methods

It is possible to edit previously added payment methods.

To edit an existing method:

1.  On the **Payment settings** page (**Store setup > Payment methods**), locate the payment method that needs to be edited and click on the **Configure** button opposite its name.

    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389794/xc5_paymentmethods_configure_method.png)

    This opens the page with the payment method's settings.

    ![configure-payment-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25BG59R3/configure-payment-page.png)

2.  Edit the settings. 

3.  Click **Save changes** to save the changes.

The payment method settings will be updated.

## Enabling / Disabling Payment Methods

You can change the availability of a payment method by switching the **INACTIVE/ACTIVE** control to the right of its name.

## Deleting Payment Methods

To remove a payment method from your store's payment methods list, click on the Trash icon icon below the method name.
