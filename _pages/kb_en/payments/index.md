Getting paid is what a business is meant for. 

Understanding the payment process is an important step toward getting paid by your customers. All of X-Cart supported payment methods rely on third-party providers to process your transactions. These providers might charge extra fees, as well as enforce rules about what products you can sell using their service. Hence each merchant should consider these factors as well as the countries where the business is located and where customers live and many other criteria when choosing a payment gateway.

After a choice of a payment processor has been made, it is time to proceed to the payment gateway configuration in your X-Cart store Admin backend.
