Getting paid is one of the most important functions of any business. Understanding the payment process is an important step towards getting paid by your customers. All of X-Cart supported payment methods rely on third-party providers to process your transactions. These providers may charge extra fees, as well as enforce rules about what products you can sell using their service. Each merchant should consider these factors as well as the countries where the business is located and where customers live and many other criteria when choosing a payment gateway.

After deciding what payment processor(s) you are going to use, you can proceed to configuring the respective payment methods in your X-Cart store. General information on how to configure and manage your payment methods can be found here:
