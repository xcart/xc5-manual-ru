PayPal is one of the largest payment processors in the world that offers many different payment solutions. Offering PayPal can make a store accessible to different types of shoppers which is critical to the store's conversion rate. Customers don’t even need a PayPal account to pay via PayPal – they can use their bank account or credit card to complete checkout, but can use their PayPal balance with an account. In case a merchant considers accepting payments on site via PayPal it's vitally important to choose a proper PayPal solution that will meet the business needs best of all. In X-Cart, a merchant has quite a big list of integrated PayPal solutions to choose from.
