An X-Cart store can be configured to accept payments with PayPal. Depending on the type of PayPal platform you require, you will need to use one of the following integration solutions: 

* **[PayPal Checkout](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal.html "PayPal")** addon for X-Cart by X-Cart team. 

   This addon can be used to enable payments via:
   
   * {% link "PayPal Commerce Platform" ref_77eLHGNI %} (PayPal Checkout in X-Cart) - The new first party type of integration of the PayPal API v2 that merges the functionality of the following old PayPal payment solutions:
     - PayPal Payments Standard
     - PayPal Payments Advanced
     - PayPal Payflow Link
     - PayPal Express Checkout
     - PayPal Credit
     - PayPal Partner Hosted with PCI Compliance
         
    * A number of PayPal API v1 based integrations like:
      - {% link "PayPal Partner Hosted with PCI Compliance" ref_0gaUolue %}
      - {% link "Paypal Payflow Link" ref_5tBeUaTL %}
      - {% link "Paypal Payments Advanced" ref_sO5X6iBT %}
      - {% link "Paypal Payments Standard" ref_6fTEi1Bv %}
   
   {% note info %}
   The new and old integrations can NOT be used at the same time.

   *   PayPal Payflow Pro

* **[PayPal Here](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/PayPal-Here-payment-module.html "PayPal")** addon for X-Cart by Qualiteam. This addon and a mobile device with the PayPal Here application installed are required to use the PayPal Here solution by PayPal.
