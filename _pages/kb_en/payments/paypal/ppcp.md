Starting with v5.4.1.7, X-Cart introduces a new PayPal integration called PayPal Commerce Platform (PPCP). This is a first party type of integration of the PayPal API v2.

The new integration is called PayPal Checkout in X-Cart Admin area and supports the following features: 
* With one integration, merchants can accept dozens of payment methods, including PayPal, PayPal Credit, major Debit and Credit cards, and local payment methods such as iDEAL.
* Credit cards are accepted through hosted fields on X-Cart checkout, allowing merchants to be PSD2 compliant and reduce their PCI compliance burden.
* Payment button tech dynamically selects the best payment methods for each buyer.
* No matter which payment method the buyer selects, all payments are received into one source, allowing for easy withdrawal and consolidated reporting.
* PayPal badge in the storefront header (can be turned off).
