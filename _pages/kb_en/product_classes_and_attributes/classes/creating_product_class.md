When you decide you need to group certain products into a product class, you begin by creating this product class.

To create a new product class:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Classes & attributes section (**Catalog >Â Classes & attributes**).
2.  Click the **New product class** button:
    ![541-classes-n-attributes.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6ieZHjOV/541-classes-n-attributes.png)

    An editable field will appear on a new line in the list of product classes:
    ![create-class-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6ieZHjOV/create-class-2.png)
3.  Use the new field to enter a name for the new product class. 
    ![create-class-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6ieZHjOV/create-class-3.png)
4.  Click **Save changes**. The newly created product class will be saved and added to the product class list:
    ![create-class-4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6ieZHjOV/create-class-4.png)

After a product class has been created, it's necessary, {% link "to add attributes" ref_kEKoAxJB#adding-product-class-attributes %} to it and then {% link "assign this product class to products" ref_4PN1b5la %}.

If necessary, you can {% link "edit the product class name or delete the product class" ref_5hLBsBtC %} altogether.
