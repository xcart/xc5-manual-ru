If required a store admin can edit product class names and delete product classes altogether.

## Editing Product Class Names

To rename a product class:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Classes & Attributes section (**Catalog > Classes & Attributes**).
2.  In the list of product classes, locate the name of a product class that needs to be edited and hover your cursor over the line in the list on which this name is located. An outline of the Product class name field will be displayed:
    ![manage-classes.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5hLBsBtC/manage-classes.png)
3.  Click inside the field containing the product class name and edit the name as you require. 
4.  Once you're done editing, click **Save changes**.
    The product class name will be updated. 

## Deleting Product Classes

Deleting a product class removes it from the product class list; any products to which the product class used to be assigned lose the product class and any attributes that were assigned to it via this product class.

To delete a product class:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Classes & Attributes section (**Catalog > Classes & Attributes**).
2.  In the list of product classes, locate the name of the product class that needs to be deleted and click on the **Trash** icon opposite it. The product class will be marked for deletion.
3.  Click **Save changes**.
    The product class name will be deleted.
