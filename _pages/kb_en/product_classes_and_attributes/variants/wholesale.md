There are 2 ways to configure wholesale prices for product variants:

1. Depending on the main product price

   In case you set up product variants the way that they don't have a variant dependent price but all have the same price as the main product, wholesale prices can be defined in the _Wholesale pricing_ tab on the product details page. The wholesale prices will be the same for all the variants.

   {% note info %}
   If you set a wholesale price in %, please, do mind that here you set not a % discount on a product, but a price in % from the price of the main product.
   {% endnote %}
    
   To set a wholesale price click the **New tier** button, specify the quantity range in the field that opens, set a price in $ or % for the quantity you speified and choose the membership if applicable. Save the changes when done.

2. Depending on each product variant price
   
   In case you set up product variants to have prices different from the price of the main product, the wholesale prices are defined in the _Variants_ tab on the product details page next to the product variant price. 
   
   ![wholesale-variant.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0uApuQfx/wholesale-variant.png)
   
   You'll need to configure wholesale prices for each variant with a price different from a default one. For this click a button next to the variant price field and set the wholesale prices on a new page that will open. There you'll need to click the **New tier** button, specify the quantity range in the field that opens, set a price in $ or % for the quantity you speified and choose the membership if applicable. Save the changes when done.

Once set up the wholesale prices will become available in the store front-end
   ![customer.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0uApuQfx/customer.png)

If product variants are configured depending on the main product price, the prices will be the same for all variants. If they are configured depending on each product variant price, the price will differ for each variant a buyer views.
