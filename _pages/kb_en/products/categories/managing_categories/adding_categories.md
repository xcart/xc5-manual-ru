## Adding Categories

To add a new category in an X-Cart store catalog:

   You can add as many new categories as you require at a time.

3. Click _**Save**_. 

You'll see the category you've just created in the list.

Now you can proceed with adding an image to the category, editing the category properties and populating it with products. 

## Addinng Subcategories

A category can have one or several subcategories that are created in a similar way as they in fact are categories of a lower level. Subcategories are created on the **Subcategories** tab of the category details page with the **New Category** button.

To edit a category/subcategory properties click the category/subcategory name on the listing page and follow the procedures described in {% link "Editing Category Details" ref_02QQDneV %}.

## Managing Categories/Subcategories Listings

A category listing page of your store Admin area (**Catalog** -> **Categories**) allows a store admin to maintain the categories sorting in the storefront, to enable/disable categories and to delete them completely if required.

The listing page also displays for a category:
- a clickable number of featured products;
- a clickable number of subcategories;
- a clickable number of products in this particular category.

The value in brackets shows the overall number of products in both that category and all its subcategories.

A category listing page in the storefront displays only the products assigned to the category itself but not to its subcategories.
