X-Cart allows populating categories with products in several different ways.

1. **Import**

   Use this method if you need to add multiple products to a category or your store it not yet populated with products. 

   See {% link "How to import data" ref_glDc6kA1 %} for a detailed guidance on products import.

2. **Bulk editing**

   Use this method if your store is already populated with products and you need to assign/re-assign categories to products. 

   See [Bulk edit categories and tags](https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/bulk_edit.html#bulk-edit-categories-and-tags "Adding Products to a Category") for a detailed guidance.

3. **Manual product creation**

   Use this method if you need to add one or several new products to a category.

   To add a product to a category in X-Cart:

    * In your store Admin area, locate a category on the category listing page (**Catalog** -> **Categories**) and proceed to the category details page.
    
    * On the category details page, open the _Product_ tab and click the **Add product** button.

      You will be redirected to the _Add products_ page (**Catalog** > **Products** > **Add products**) where you can specify the product properties as described in [Adding a New Product](https://kb.x-cart.com/products/products/managing_products/adding_products/#adding-a-new-product "Adding Products to a Category"). 
      
    Generally, the _Products_ tab of the category details page is aimed to display a list of products assigned to that category:
