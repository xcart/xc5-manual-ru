When creating a new product, you need to specify product details via the form fields of the "Add product" page. 

{% note info %}
The actual set of fields available to you on this page depends on the X-Cart edition you are using and the set of addons enabled. 

If you do not see some of the fields described below in your X-Cart store back end, it means that the addon that enables this field is not installed or is not active. To see what addons are active in your store and, if necessary, to install/activate more addons, check the **My addons** section in your X-Cart store Admin area. 

More info on the management of X-Cart addons can be found in the {% link "Managing addons" ref_gTOegEua %} section of this manual.
{% endnote %}

The following list of fields corresponds to the set of product fields available for configuration on a fresh install of X-Cart Ultimate edition:

## General Info

![5410-product-details-info.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2D8wAeXP/5410-product-details-info.png)

*   **Vendor**: Company name and email of the vendor who owns the product. 
    
    This field is only available if X-Cart's {% link "Multi-vendor" ref_cvwmAuRi %} addon is active. Since an administrator can create products not only for themselves, but also for other users (vendors), this field needs to be adjusted to specify the owner of the product.

*   **Product name**: The name by which you and your customers will identify this product.

*   **SKU**: The product SKU (A code that will serve as a unique identifier for this product). If you leave this field blank, a SKU will be generated automatically when the product is saved.

*   **Images**: Use this section to add images for the product. Note that X-Cart does not impose strict limitations regarding the size of product images that can be uploaded because it can resize and crop images automatically for best appearance on various types of store pages. For example, X-Cart will use the original image uploaded by you via this section to create different sized images for the product details page, the product list page in list view and the product list page in grid view. The dimensions to which the original image will be resized and cropped are set in the Images section of your store's Admin area (**Look&Feel** -> **Images**); these dimensions may be different depending on the skin used by your store and can be changed manually, if required. For more info on the management of images, including product images, see the section {% link "Managing Images" ref_zyQIOcia %}.

*   **Category**: The category (or categories) to which this product belongs. 

*   **Description**: A short product description that will be displayed on product list pages.

*   **Full description**: A longer product description that will be displayed on the product details page.

*   **Allow buyers to attach files to this product**: This field is only available if X-Cart's "[Customer Files Uploads & Product Attachments](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/files-uploads-product-attachments.html?sl=en&utm_source=XC5admin&utm_medium=addons_list_installed&utm_campaign=XC5admin "Adding products")" addon is active.

*   **Tags**: This field is only available if X-Cart's {% link "Product Tags" ref_6nFoxYf1 %} addon is active; it enables you to assign tags defined via the Product tags section (**Catalog** > **Tags**) to the current product.

*   **Available for sale**: Whether the product should be displayed on the storefront. Uncheck this option to temporarily remove the product from the storefront (Store visitors will not be able to see it).

    <a id="available-for-sale"></a>
    
    {% note info %}    
    If you disable the **Available for sale** option, the product will become inactive, and store visitors who will attempt to access the page of this product via a direct link will see the 404 "Page not found" error. If necessary, you can set redirects for the pages of disabled products using .htacces or the [Redirects](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/redirects-by-Nova-Horizons.html "Adding products") addon. 
  
    If you do not want to sell a product any longer but want a product page be still accessible on the storefront, set the product's stock to zero and add "Not available for sale" to the product name, rather than making it inactive. Make sure the _How to show out of stock products_ option is set to "Show in all the sections" in the **Store setup** -> **Cart & checkout** section of the admin area. 
    {% endnote %}
    
*   **Call for price**: This field is only available if X-Cart's {% link "Call For Price" ref_3K1pJExV %} addon is active; it enables you to specify that the price and Add to cart button must not be provided for the current product; instead, a message inviting store visitors to call for price should be displayed.

    This field is enabled by the {% link "Sale" ref_7tBJ8Yqo %} addon.

*   **Arrival date**: This field allows you to specify the date since when the product is or will be available in your store. On its own, the information entered in this field serves purely informational purposes, but it may be employed by X-Cart addons. For example, it is used by the addon "Product Advisor" which enables you to mark specific products in your catalog as "Coming soon" publishing their expected arrival date for the store visitors to see and automatically switches the status of such products to "New arrival" on the date of arrival.

*   **Automatic reward points**: Use this field to specify whether reward points for buying the current product should be calculated from the product price automatically or adjusted manually.

*   **Inventory tracking**: Whether you wish to use the inventory tracking feature for this product.

Every time someone buys the product, the number in the "Quantity in stock" field will be reduced automatically by the number of units that have been purchased. If you have a stock refill, you edit the value in the  "Quantity in stock" field increasing the value by the number of units you require. As a result, you will be able to tell how many units of the product you have in stock at any time. If the product quantity is unlimited and does not need to be tracked, the inventory tracking feature can be disabled.

You can insert the number of units available for backordering into this message by using the "%number%" placeholder; for example: "You can backorder up to %number% items."

*   **Limit the backorder quantity**: This field is only available if the setting "Available for backorder" is enabled. It allows you to specify that only a limited number of units of the current product can be purchased on backorder, and to specify the maximum limit via the **Max. backorder quantity** field (appears when the "Limit the backorder quantity" option is enabled).
