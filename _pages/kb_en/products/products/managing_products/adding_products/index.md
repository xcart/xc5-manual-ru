There are more than one ways to add products to your store. You can use the built-in add/edit tool to manually create products one by one in the store Admin area, or you can upload products to your store in bulk using a CSV-formatted file. For some X-Cart versions, there's also an option to [migrate](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/migration/getting_started_with_store_migration.html#step-2-data-migration-with-a-store-migration-app "Adding Products") your product catalog from another platform to X-Cart using a migration app.

This guide covers the basics of how to create a product in the store admin area manually. 

{% note info %}
If you are interested in adding products to your store through an imported spreadsheet, see the section {% link "Import-Export" ref_TANvG2De %} for more information. 
{% endnote %}

To create a product, it is enough just to specify its name. The rest of the product details can be configured later on.

## Adding a New Product

To add a new product:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the products listing page (**Catalog** > **Products**).
    ![541-product-listing-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_fhzzxDTy/541-product-listing-page.png)

2.  Click the **Add product** button.
    ![541-add-product-button.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_fhzzxDTy/541-add-product-button.png)
    
    The "Add product" page opens.
    ![541-add-product-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_fhzzxDTy/541-add-product-page.png)

3.  Use the fields on the "Add product" page to provide information about the product. 
    
    The page contains quite a number of fields, but you do not have to set all of them right now: the only required field is **Product name**, which means you only have to provide that value, whereas the rest of the product fields may be configured at any time later. See the {% link "Product Details" ref_2D8wAeXP %} guide for a detailed explanation of all the product page fields. 

4.  To save the product information you have provided, click **Add product** at the bottom of the page. The new product will be saved. 
    
    If necessary, you will be able to find this product on the products listing page (**Catalog** > **Products**) to do further editing or to specify some advanced product settings (See the {% link "Advanced Product Details" ref_2kV8GKN7 %} guide for more info).
