You can configure your X-Cart 5 store to showcase the most popular products (the ones that have been purchased at your store the most often) in a separate section where your store visitors will be more likely to see them. This feature is available through the use of the **Bestsellers** addon by X-Cart team. To use the feature, make sure this addon is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_0fGEpvrh %} in your store.

Your best selling products are displayed on a separate store page available via the **Hot deals** menu:
![bestsellers_menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers_menu.png)

There is also a block titled "Bestsellers" in the main column of your store site (you may need to scroll down to see it). You can find it on the Home page as well as on category pages.
For example, here is the "Bestsellers" block as it is displayed on the Home page in our demo store:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers_block_home.png)![bestsellers_block_home.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers_block_home.png)
And here is the "Bestsellers" block as it is displayed on the page of the category "Fashion":
![bestsellers_block_category.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers_block_category.png)
Note that the number of bestsellers shown within the block is different in these two cases. That is due to the fact that the block on the Home page shows best selling products from the entire store, whereas the block on the category page - only the bestsellers from the current category and its subcategories.

The products for the "Bestsellers" block are selected automatically based on your store's product sales statistics. You specify the maximum number of products that can be shown within the block, and X-Cart populates this block with the specified number of products choosing the ones that have been purchased by your customers the most often. 

If necessary, it is possible to move the block to a different location using the Layout Editor in [Webmaster Mode](https://devs.x-cart.com/webinars_and_video_tutorials/using_webmaster_mode_in_x-cart_5.html).

The maximum number of products that can be shown within the "Bestsellers" block on the Home page and on the category pages can be adjusted as follows:

   1. Use the **Settings** link to access the "Bestsellers" addon settings page.
      ![bestsellers1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers1.png)
      
      The addon settings page looks like the following:
      ![bestsellers2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_p1CIVmy6/bestsellers2.png)
    
   2. Adjust the number of products as you require. 
    
   3. Save the changes by clicking **Submit**.
