You can configure your X-Cart 5 store so that it shows a "Recently viewed" block where store visitors can view the products they viewed recently.

The "Recently viewed" block in X-Cart 5 is available through the use of **Product Advisor** module by X-Cart team. If you want to use this feature, make sure that this module is installed and enabled at your store:

To adjust the way recently viewed products should be displayed to your store's visitors, you will need to adjust some module settings:

1.  Go to the **Settings** page for the addon "Product Advisor".

2.  Scroll down to the section **"Recently viewed" block settings**.

    Adjust the following settings:
    *   **Display "Recently viewed" block in catalog**: Enable this option to enable the display of the "Recently viewed" section on the storefront.
    *   **Maximum number of products to display in "Recently viewed" block**: Specify the maximum number of products that can be shown in the "Recently viewed" section.

3.  Once you are done configuring the settings, click the **Submit** button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.
