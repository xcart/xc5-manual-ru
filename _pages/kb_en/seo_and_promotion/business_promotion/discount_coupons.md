X-Cart 5 allows you to create coupons for your customers. A coupon is a secret code which a customer can use to get a discount on their order - typically, a fixed amount or a percentage off, or free shipping. It is possible to limit the use of a coupon to a specific order subtotal amount, time period, product category, product class or user membership level. If necessary, it is also possible to set the number of times that a coupon can be used.

The coupons feature in X-Cart 5 is enabled by the addon **[Coupons](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/discount-coupons.html)**:
![coupons_addon.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SGI1FqdC/coupons_addon.png)

To be able to use free shipping coupons, you also require the addon **[Free Shipping and Shipping freights](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/free-shipping.html)**. 
![free_ship_addon.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SGI1FqdC/free_ship_addon.png)

To start creating coupons for your customers, make sure the above said addons are installed and enabled at your store. If not, you can install them from the X-Cart App Store. For general addon installation instructions, see {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

When the **Coupons** addon is enabled, a link **Have a discount coupon?** is provided at checkout. 
![xc5_coupons_haveacoupon.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SGI1FqdC/xc5_coupons_haveacoupon.png)

Buyers can use this link to expand a section where they can enter their coupon code:
![xc5_coupons_haveacoupon1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SGI1FqdC/xc5_coupons_haveacoupon1.png)

Provided that a valid coupon code is being used, the coupon will be applied to the order:
![xc5_coupons_couponapplied.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SGI1FqdC/xc5_coupons_couponapplied.png)

The result will be reflected at checkout:
![xc5_coupons_couponapplied1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SGI1FqdC/xc5_coupons_couponapplied1.png)

If an invalid coupon code is entered (for example, if the coupon code is misspelled, expired or otherwise does not meet the coupon application conditions), the user will be informed of the problem. For example, here is the result of using an expired coupon code:
