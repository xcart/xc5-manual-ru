If you set up carrier-calculated or table-based shipping rates for your products, but want to increase the amount you charge customers for shipping a little bit to coverÂ additional expenses like insurance or packing cost, you can do it by adding a _handling fee_. In X-Cart 5, handling fee is a fixed surcharge that is applied to orders shipped using a specific shipping method. The handling fee is added at checkout and is merged with your standard shipping rates, so the surcharge remains invisible to the buyers.

To set up a handling fee for some shipping method:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Shipping methods section (**Store setup** -> **Shipping**):
    ![541-shipping-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_nFJTxPMR/541-shipping-page.png)
2.  In the list of your store's shipping methods, find the method that you want to add a surcharge for.

3.  Click inside the _Handling fee_ field for the selected shipping method and specify the surcharge amount you require either as a fixed amount or as a
percentage off the order subtotal amount.

4.  **Save changes** 


That's it! The handling fee value is added.
