Once an order has been paid for, you will need to deliver the ordered goods to the buyer. Unless those are products that do not require shipping (like {% link "digital goods" ref_lxNH6TFr %}, {% link "bookable products" ref_4IYL2Shf %} or {% link "PIN codes" ref_4JeE99n8 %}), you will have to arrange the packaging, pickup and delivery. 

A store owner can choose between hiring a third-party postal or delivery service and charging actual carrier rates, charging a flat rate for shipping and arranging delivery on their own, offering free shipping or enabling local pickup. In any case, before considering the actual shipping strategy for a store, a merchant needs to configure the ship-from address that can either be a real store address or a warehouse address.
