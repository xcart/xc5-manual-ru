Once an order has been paid for, you will need to deliver the ordered goods to the buyer. Unless those are products that do not require shipping (like {% link "digital goods" ref_lxNH6TFr %}, {% link "bookable products" ref_4IYL2Shf %} or {% link "PIN codes" ref_4JeE99n8 %}), you will have to arrange the packaging, pickup and delivery. 

As a store owner, you will be able to choose your shipping strategy and configure your store's shipping methods and rates. If you are required to charge tax on shipping, you will be able to adjust your store's tax configuration to accommodate this need as well.
