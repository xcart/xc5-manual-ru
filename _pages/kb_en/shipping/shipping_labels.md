Shipping labels provide key information to each actor of your supply chain to move your package from one hand to another, from the warehouse to your customer’s doorstep. Hence using shipping labels simplifies the delivery process and makes it straightforward. 

Each carrier designed their label so that they are optimized with their own process, at the routing center and at the storage warehouse. Shipping labels are designed to be read by both machines and humans. Being clear and easy to read is a top priority.

On a shipping label, you’ll see barcodes, numbers and letters. Each area is being used along the way to inform specific partners of the supply chain.

X-Cart is integrated with the following carrier providers that support shipping labes generation:

* {% link "Canada Post" ref_ifwLo5ks %}
