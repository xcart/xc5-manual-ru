Both the UK and the EU use value-added tax system (VAT). Each European country and the UK has a different VAT rate that can be charged by a merchant only if the business is registered for VAT. A registered business must provide a VAT invoice in case there is no VAT exemption for the goods.

VAT rates and VAT exemptions in X-Cart can be set up using one of the following addons:

* **[Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/uk-vat.html)** - an addon for manual configuration of VAT/GST. Can be used for any country with VAT/GST taxation.  The addon allows configuring different tax rates based on the membership level and address of the customer. It also supports tax exemption based on the customerâ€™s VAT ID. See the {% link "Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax addon manual" ref_0GjdgNJx %}.
 
* **[AvaTax Sales Tax Automation](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/avatax-sales-tax-automation.html)** - an addon for integration with AvaTax, a sales tax automation service by Avalara. See the {% link "AvaTax Sales Tax Automation addon manual" ref_6880bVvi %}.
