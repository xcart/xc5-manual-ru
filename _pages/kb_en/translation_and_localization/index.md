An X-Cart store installed from a US pack provides a user interface (both the storefront and the Admin area) in the English language and employs the units of measure that are in use in the United States. There is also a UK pack that is slightly different in terms of the language used for the user interface and provides a different default customer and admin address configuration. 

Any merchant located outside the given countries can adapt the default X-Cart software to a specific locale or market by installing the language package they require and configuring the localization settings appropriately.
