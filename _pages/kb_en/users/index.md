An online store is no store without users. In an X-Cart store, there are different types of users, each type with their own specific functions. You can learn about X-Cart user types in the section {% link "User Types in X-Cart" ref_PWr4CNvW %}.

In the store, each user is represented by a user account linked to all the user information (user profile). Different types of users have different privileges. Users with user management privileges (typically administrators acting on behalf of the store owner) can manage the accounts and profiles of other store users. For example, they can access and edit the information in other users' profiles, force a logged-in user to log out, check how the store looks and functions for another user or do some task for another user (like create an order on behalf of a customer). You can find more information on user management in the section {% link "User Management" ref_3JDroIa2 %}. 

A user's level of access to the system is defined by their role. More information on user roles and their management is available in the section {% link "User Roles" ref_38HKdc1f %}.
