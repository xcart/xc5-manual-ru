An online store is no store without users. X-Cart has two main types of user accounts available in all X-Cart editions - administrators (also known as admins) and customers. 

Store admins are users who configure, maintain, and run the store. There can be either one or more than one admins in the same store. If necessary admins can be given different access privileges according to the roles they need to perform in the store. Store admins can also act as any registered user (for example, another admin or registered customer). 

Customers are regular store visitors, or buyers. Customers can be registered and anonymous. A registered customer is a buyer who saved the e-mail used to make an order and thus created an account in your store this way. An anonymous customer is a buyer who ordered anything in your store without saving the email used to place the order. This does not mean that X-Cart does not create a customer account for anonymous buyers at all. In fact, it does, and it saves all the info the buyer has provided for possible future reference. If such a buyer decides to register an account with the e-mail used to place orders previously, a store admin can merge the newly registered customer account with the existing records to save the history of purchases for this buyer. Registered customers can be differentiated and given privileges (via discounted prices, wholesale offers, etc.) according to their memberships.

X-Cart also allows to create separate accounts for sellers (aka vendors) in case you are running an e-mall or a marketplace based on {% link "X-Cart Multivendor edition" ref_4ahg5FLK %}. Vendors are less privileged than the store admins and have a limited access to the store (they mainly manage the products they own).
