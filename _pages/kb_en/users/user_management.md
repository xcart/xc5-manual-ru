The management of users in an X-Cart based store takes place in the Users section of the Admin area (**Users** > **Users**). To manage customers, a user must either be an X-Cart administrator with root access or an administrator with the permission to manage users; to manage administrators, a user must be a root administrator or an administrator with the permission to manage administrators (specific permissions can be set via the Roles section of the Admin area (**Users** > **Roles**).

In the Users section of the Admin area, the store users can be seen as a list presented in the form of a table. For each user, the table provides the following information:
     
   *   Login/Email;
   *   Name;
   *   Access level (_Administrator_, _Customer_ or _Anonymous_ + information about the user's membership level, if any; for example, "Customer (VIP customers)" means that the user is a registered customer with the membership level "VIP customers", whereas "Customer (requested for VIP customers)" means that the user is a registered customer and they have submitted a request for "VIP customers" membership which has yet to be approved by the store admin. Note that in X-Cart Multivendor there are users with an access level named _Vendor_; for more info on this, see the {% link "Multi-vendor manual" ref_cvwmAuRi %});
   *   Orders (Number of orders placed by the user; the number link can be clicked upon for access to the list of all the orders by this user);
   *   Created (Account creation date);
   *   Last login (Date of the user's latest login to their user account). 
   
The filter above the table can be used to filter the table contents and find specific users.

The administrator with user management permissions can access the profile of any user in the table for viewing/editing. To access the profile of a user, click on the user login/email link in the Login/Email column or the user name link in the Name column. 

The administrator can remove user accounts. To remove a user account, click on the Trash icon opposite the user name in the table column at the far right (this marks the user account for removal), then click **Save changes**.

The administrator can export user account information to CSV format.  To export the entire users table, click the button **Export all: CSV** below the table. To export the information for specific users, mark these users by selecting the check boxes before their names, then click the button **Export selected: CSV** (This button is displayed in the place of the **Export all: CSV** button when at least one user is selected).

The administrator can create new user accounts directly from Users section in the Admin area. To create a new user account, click the **Add user** button above the users table and use the Create profile form to specify the account details for the new user. Note that while creating a new user account, you may want to give them a {% link "membership level" ref_RXsgxNSm %}. If creating an administrator user, you will also have to set their  {% link "role" ref_38HKdc1f %} to define the access permissions this user should have in the Admin area.

The administrator can force a user to log out. To do so, open the user's profile and select the option _Logout this user_ from the Profile actions drop-down.

Sometimes the administrator may need to check how the store looks and functions for another user, or to do some task for them (for example, create an order on behalf of a customer). In this case, the administrator can use the {% link "Operate as a user" feature" ref_26UftgNS %}.
