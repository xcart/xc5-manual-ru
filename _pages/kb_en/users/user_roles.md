A role in X-Cart is a set of permissions providing access to certain features and areas of the store Admin area. X-Cart roles enable a store root admin to configure different levels of access to the store's back end for different administrator users. This feature may be useful if you have staff who you want to delegate some work on the store maintenance but don't want to give this staff full access to the store Admin area. 

Roles are added to the core X-Cart via the addon **User permissions**. This module comes for free with X-Cart Business, Multivendor and Ultimate editions.

## Roles Listing Page

Typically, if you are using X-Cart Business, Multivendor or Ultimate, the addon **User permissions** is already enabled, and your X-Cart store already has some roles configured - you can view them in the **Roles** section of the Admin area (**Users** > **Roles**).
    ![roles-section.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_38HKdc1f/roles-section.png)

_Administrator_ is the role with the **root access** permissions to the store Admin area, which means that an administrator with this role has full access to all the features (no restrictions at all). This is the only role in X-Cart that can't be edited or deleted.

The rest of the configured roles provide limited access to a store Admin area so that a person could work with just some of the features (sections). 

## Roles Configuration

Roles are totally configurable. Each role consists of a set of access permissions. You can create new roles or edit existing ones and assign as many access permissions to one role as you find necessary. You can also delete the roles you do not need.

### Access Permissions

A full list of access permissions available in a default X-Cart store is as follows:

   * **Root access** : Gives a full access to the store Admin area (with no limitations at all).
   * **Manage catalog** : Gives access to several pages of the **Catalog** section of the strore Admin area, where this user can manage all products including product categories, tags, classes and attributes. Also this user get access to the **Content** -> **Featured products** section of the Admin area to manage featured products. 
   * **Manage reviews** : Gives access to the **Catalog** -> **Reviews** page of the store Admin area where this user can manage existing and create new product reviews.
   * **Manage users** : Gives access to the **Users** -> **User list** page of the Admin area, where this user can manage existing and create new customer accounts. 
   * **Manage administrators** : Extends the **Manage users** access permission with a possibility to manage existing and create new admin and vendor accounts (including root admins). The **Manage administrators** access permission doesn't allow to assign new or change existing roles assigned to different admin accounts.
   * **Manage orders** : Gives access to several pages of the **Orders** section of the store Admin area, where this user can process orders in full, including working with order statuses, payment transactions, order stats and messages.

This access permission can be used only in bundle with other access permissions that give access to different text areas of the store Admin area (e.g. **Manage catalog**, **Manage reviews**, etc.).
