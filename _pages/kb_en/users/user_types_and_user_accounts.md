X-Cart has two major types of users depending on the X-Cart store area where they primarily operate:

   *   Administrators (aka admins);
   *   Customers.
   
X-Cart administrators are users with access to the Admin area - the back end of an X-Cart store that provides various tools for the store configuration, as well as the management of products, orders and users. Every X-Cart store has at least one administrator, but may have multiple administrators if the store owner chooses to create additional administrator accounts. Additional administrator accounts may be set up with full or limited access to the stores's back end with the help of {% link "Roles" ref_38HKdc1f %} .

X-Cart customers are users of the Customer area - the zone of an X-Cart store where one can view and buy products. Generally, we may call anyone who views the storefront and acts as a shopper (this includes viewing products, adding products to the shopping cart and placing orders) a "customer". Not all customers, however, are the same: some just browse through the site and leave, others choose to buy stuff. Those who choose to buy stuff may do it as a guest without registering an account, or may prefer to create an account so as to have access to their order history and be able to reuse their registration name and address for future purchases. If we wanted to emphasize the difference between these types of customers, we would say that the ones who come to the store and navigate the site viewing the publicly accessible pages of the Customer area are just "visitors" or "shoppers", the ones who sign up for an account and maintain a user profile with the store are "registered customers", and the ones who make a purchase without creating an account or logging in to an existing account are "anonymous customers". Speaking about the management of X-Cart users, it is only the latter two types of customers that a store administrator may hope to manage. Registered customers have a user account that represents them in the store system and can be used to access their profile information and order history. Anonymous customers do not have an account, but can be traced as a source of orders and can be converted to regular registered customers.
